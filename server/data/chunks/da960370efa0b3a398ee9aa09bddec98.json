So is 1, ½, ⅓, … and π, π2, π3,. … A sequence is an infinite set of real numbers that are listed in order as a1, a2, a3, … We call each of the particular numbers a term in the sequence. So the first term is a1, the second term is a2, and the n th term is an. When we are in a really good mood, we might use the shorthand notation {an} or {an}∞n = 1 for our sequence. So {1/n} is a short way of writing 1, ½, ⅓,. … The sequence {1 + (–1)n} is just given by 0, 2, 0, 2,. … The Sequence Hall of Fame is where the greatest sequences of all time are honored. There are the celebrities, the ones everyone knows, like 1, 2, 3, … or 2, 4, 6, 8, …, and there are the ones that are less well known, but revered by sequence lovers worldwide. One of these is the Fibonacci sequence. Example 1 The Fibonacci sequence, denoted Fn, is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, … Each term of the sequence after the first two is obtained by adding together the previous two terms. We can write a so-called recursive formula for the sequence as These numbers appear in a variety of places in biology, the most well-known of which is the frisky rabbit problem, but it also applies to frisky mice, frisky birds and, perish the thought, frisky porcupines. Example 2 Rabbits are physically able to reproduce at 1 month of age, and the period for gestation is 1 month. If each time she gives birth, the female produces a pair of rabbits, who themselves will reproduce when old enough, starting with a single pair of baby male and female rabbits, how many pairs of rabbits will there be running around after n months? Solution We begin with one pair of baby rabbits. So F1 =",

    "content": "Hey, whatever makes your nose twitch. 4.2 Limits of sequences What happens when you follow a sequence really far out, right to the limit? Let’s take a look at limits of sequences, like . The idea is to take the limit of the function f(n) just like we took limits of functions f(x) as x went to ∞. All of the standard rules apply. Example Determine the limit of the sequence . Solution We treat this sequence just the way we would treat the function if we wanted to take its limit as x went to ∞. Letting n go to ∞, we see that this expression is of the form . So it’s an indeterminate form, which means we get to apply L’Hôpital’s rule: Hey, whatever pops your bubble wrap. 4.3 Series: the basic idea What’s the difference between a good series and a bad series? In a good series, the plot lines all converge at the end of each episode, and you have some sense of completion. Examples include Seinfeld, MASH, Gilligan’s Island, and Murphy Brown. In a bad series, the various plotlines meander this way and that, never converging at the end of the show, and leaving the viewers confused and depleted. Examples include Melrose Place, The Young and the Restless, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. So it’s clear that in order to have a successful series, you need convergence. Well, that is the essense of this chapter. But the series here don’t involve Elaine’s troubles with the Soup Nazi. Instead, they involve summing up a whole lot of numbers, and we mean a WHOLE LOT. We will take all of the numbers in an infinite sequence and add them together. An infinite series is a sum of the form: a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an + · · · We will also express this in the summation notation as . Sometimes we start with n = 0, so But we are going to have to be careful about what an infinite sum like this means. How do we make sense of adding up infinitely many numbers? As we usually do when confronted with infinity in math, we define it in terms of a limit. But first, let’s look at the corresponding finite sums. Definition The nth partial sum of a series is given by In other words, it is the sum of the first n terms of the series. As we continue, Sn is getting to look more and more like the infinite series. So it makes sense to say: Sum of a Series If , then We say the series converges to S. If does not exist, we say that the series diverges. Example 1 1 + 1 + 1 + · · ·. Notice that S1 = 1, S2, = 2, and Sn = n. So The limit does not exist and the series diverges. Example 2 ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + · · · Then S1 = ½, S2 = 3/4, S3 = 7/8, and . Since we know that the series converges to",

    "content": "These two examples demonstrate the two basic behaviors of series. Some blow up in your face and some converge nicely to a finite number. One way to think about this basic difference is in terms of bathtubs. THE BATHTUB ANALOGY Think of an infinite series in terms of putting water in a bathtub. We begin by plugging up the empty tub. Then we use a measuring cup to dump in an amount of water corresponding to the first term in the series. We then dump in an amount of water corresponding to the second term. We repeat this process with each subsequent term in the series, as in Figure 4.",

    "content": "So in Example 1 above, we put in first 1 cup of water, and then another cup and another cup. Eventually the bathtub is going to overflow. It doesn’t matter how big the bathtub is, eventually it will overflow. It could be as big as the Pacific Ocean and eventually it will overflow. It could be as big as Donald Trump’s ego and eventually it will overflow. That’s what it means to diverge. On the other hand, if we took the second series, the story is a bit different. First we put a half cup of water in the tub, then a quarter cup, and then an eighth of a cup. We continue this process forever. Does the tub overflow? Hardly. After repeating this process an infinite number of times, we have a grand total of 1 cup of water in the tub. Not enough to wash a big hamster. Notice that the bathtub analogy tells us something else. The first few terms are really irrelevant when deciding whether a series converges or diverges. If the series does diverge, it will overflow any size bathtub, and it won’t matter if the first term was a cup or half a cup. In fact, now that you mention it, it doesn’t matter what the first million terms look like. Ultimately, what determines convergence or divergence is the rest of the terms, not the first million or billion. So the series Figure 4.1 Summing a series is like filling a bathtub. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + 1/16 + · · · converges since the series ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + 1/16 + · · · converges. The same holds even if there were a trillion 1’s at the beginning of the first series. Hey, whatever squares your root. 4.4 Geometric series: the extroverts When confronted with a series, the goal is to determine whether or not it converges, and if it does, to try and find out to what. But series do not readily disclose this information. Many of them prefer not to share. Luckily, many series do not fall in this category. They are more than happy to tell you whether or not they converge, and if they converge, to what. Given the chance, they will talk your ear off. They are the friendliest series you are likely to meet, true extroverts. Speaking of which, how do you tell an introverted mathematician from an extroverted mathematician? The extrovert looks at your shoes. Back to the extroverted series. Here are some examples: l + ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + · · · 1 + ⅓ + 1/9 + 1/27 + · · · These are geometric series, as the terms form what is called a geometric progression. This means that each term is obtained from the previous term by multiplying by a fixed number. For the first series, the fixed number is ½, and for the second series, the fixed number is ⅓. The general form of a series like this is a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · Every term is obtained from the previous term by multiplying by the same number r. When you come across a geometric series, it’s a cause for celebration, because geometric series are completely understood. So pull out the party hats! Geometric Series Test The geometric series a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · converges to and diverges if |r| ≥",

If the series doesn’t pass this test, it’s over. The series diverges. This test says that if the individual terms are not getting really small, then the bathtub will overflow. In mathematical language: nth-Term Test If , the infinite series diverges. Example 1 . Solution This series diverges since . Talk about an easy test to perform. BUT THIS TEST DOES NOT WORK IN REVERSE. There are series where, but the series still does not converge. The classic example is the so-called harmonic series given by 1 + ½ + ⅓ + · · ·. We’ll shortly see that it diverges. Common Mistake Just because the an’s shrink to 0 does not mean that the series Σan converges. 4.6 Integral test and p-series: more friends We would like to know whether or not a series converges. Does it add up to some finite number or does it blow up in your face? We will develop a collection of tests to see what it does. Some of the tests will show that the particular series we’re looking at and another series are partners in crime, meaning the one converges if and only if the other one does. This next test shows that under certain circumstances, the series and an improper integral are partners in crime. This test and the next few will apply to positive term series, that is, series in which all the terms are positive numbers. Integral Test If an = f(n), where f is positive valued, continuous, and decreasing for x ≥ 1, then and are partners in crime; either both converge or both diverge. Why It Works We will first show that if converges, then should converge as well. From Figure 4.3, we see that the area under the curve y = f(x), as x goes from 1 to ∞, is greater than the sum of the areas under the rectangles. But notice that the first rectangle has height f(2), which is a2, and width",

(There is actually more work to do here, since just having an upper bound does not ensure convergence, but we won’t go into that.) So, a2 + a3 + a4 + · · · converges. But if it converges, adding one term a1 won’t change that, so a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + · · · converges as well. Now we’ll show that if diverges, then so does the series. We’ll work from Figure 4.",

HARMONIC SERIES Let’s apply the integral test to the harmonic series given by This is possibly the most famous series alive. Why, you ask? What makes a series famous? What makes anyone famous? First you have to get a little famous, and then you have to be involved in a scandal. Well, 1 + ½ + ⅓ + · · · is obviously a little famous. After all, we just take the reciprocals of 1, 2, 3, 4, … and add them together. It’s hard to imagine a simpler series that satisfies the nth term test and that therefore has a chance to converge. And what’s the scandal? Let’s see. Since an = 1/n = f(n) where f(x) = 1/x and since 1/x is positive, continuous and decreasing for all x ≥ 1, the integral test applies. So and are partners in crime. They either both converge or both diverge. But So the integral and the series both diverge! The tiny terms in this series, 1, ½, ⅓, …, add up to infinity! In other words, if we start with a bathtub, and we put in 1 cup of water, and then half a cup and then a third, eventually it will overflow. If we start with an empty Pacific Ocean, and put in 1 cup of water, then a half and then a third, eventually it will overflow. But it will take a long, long time. Just to have enough terms to add up to 5, we must use 83 terms in the series. To add to 10, we need to use 12,667 terms in the series. To add to 20, we need about 272,400,000 terms in the series. And to add to 1000, we must use 1.1 × 10434 terms in the series. To put this in perspective, it is estimated that there are 1080 atoms in the entire observable universe. This is a series that diverges, but oh so very slowly. Don’t use this to fill your bathtub, unless you have a few quadrillion years on your hands and nothing better to do. p-SERIES The harmonic series is part of a family of series well known to people who hang out with series. We could only be speaking of the famous p-series. Definition A p-series is a series of the form , with p >",

Yup, you heard right. Investigators for the Invigor Health Maintenance Organization. Perhaps you’ve heard of us. We’ve been in the press a lot lately for giving free trips to Aruba to doctors who minimize services. “That leg’s not broken. It’s always looked like that.” That kind of thing. And I know what you are thinking. What moral individual would work for a company like this? The answer is, “No moral individual.” I guess that tells you something about me. And in a parasitic organization like this one, who are the lowest of the low, the bottom-feeders, the ones who ultimately determine whether you get the Viagra or not? That’s right, it’s me and Bob. The Marleys. Our job is to investigate claims for payment. This particular case involved an especially insidious situation. You’ve heard about it, but to most people, that’s as close as they ever come. That’s right, I’m talking about domination. Domination of one series by another. Seems that when each term in a series is at least as large as the corresponding term in a second series, we say the first series dominates the second. That is to say, if Σai and Σbi are the two series and for every single possible i, ai ≥ bi, then we say Σai dominates Σbi. In case you’re not keeping up, take and . Then so dominates . Get the idea? Not pretty, is it? But some series get off on humiliation. What can you do? Now why should anybody care about such things? If two series want to play a little domination in private, should it be any skin off my nose, or Bob’s? No, of course not. Live and let live. Whatever trims your shrubbery. But this particular pair of series likes it rough. Real rough. We’re talking about a stilletto heel firmly planted in the center of the back, and it’s all the better if you have a slipped disk.

But think about balloons for a second. If the outside balloon doesn’t pop, meaning that the series Σbn converges, and the volume of the balloon is finite, the inside balloon can’t pop either, since it has a smaller volume. So the smaller series, Σan, also converges. Figure 4.5 Each term in the series adds air to the balloon. Figure 4.6 . On the other hand, if the smaller balloon does pop, meaning the smaller series Σan diverged, then the bigger balloon must also have popped, since it must have a larger volume, meaning the bigger series Σbn must also have diverged. Simple enough. But there are two other possibilities as well. What do they say? If the smaller balloon doesn’t pop, the bigger balloon may not pop or it may pop. We get absolutely no info. No help here. Nada informata. And if the bigger balloon pops, so what? The smaller balloon is completely unaffected by that. It might pop, it might not. The balloon analogy allows us to keep track of the four possibilities, two of which tell us something and two of which do not. Example 1 Determine which of the following series converge or diverge. a. has the bigger denominator. So The bigger series is a geometric series with r = ⅓ < 1, so it converges. The smaller series converges as well, by the basic comparison test. Big balloon doesn’t pop implies small balloon doesn’t pop. b. because has the smaller denominator. Since the smaller series is , a p-series with p = ½ < 1, it diverges. By the basic comparison test, if the smaller series diverges, so must the larger. Smaller balloon pops means bigger balloon pops. c. Our first inclination is to compare this to diverges since it is the harmonic series. If the larger series diverges (big balloon pops), then we know absolutely nothing about the smaller series. (Small balloon could pop, or not.) So this comparison was a waste of time. Too bad. What else could we do? How about this? . But the smaller series is This is just one-half times the harmonic series, and so it diverges. Half of infinity is still infinity! And if the smaller series diverges, so does the larger. Done! Finally, we will just note that in fact there is an easier way to do this last one, which is just to write out the series. We see that this series is really just the harmonic series missing its first term, so it must diverge. d. This one is a problem. Notice that if we try to apply the basic comparison test in the obvious way, we have . Unfortunately, the bigger series is a p-series with p = ½ < 1, so it diverges, telling us nothing about the smaller series. We need a new test! What luck! Here comes one now. Limit Comparison Test If and are positive term series, and for some positive number k, then either both series converge or both series diverge. They are partners in crime, the Bonnie and Clyde of the series set. The point is that the two series are behaving very similarly when n gets large. If k = 1, the terms in the two series are getting closer and closer to being the same. If k equals any other number, the terms are getting closer and closer to being just a multiple by k of each other. So we expect the series to behave the same. It is only when the limit is 0 or ∞ that the series might not behave the same. Example",

When we start with a series of all positive terms, and change the sign of every other term, we get an alternating series. For example, we might have 1 – ½ + ⅓ – ¼ + 1/5 – · · · Often, it is relatively easy to tell that such a series converges. Alternating Series Test If each an is positive, an + 1 ≤ an for all n, and , then the corresponding alternating series converges. Let’s see how we apply this. Example 1 Does converge? Solution First we check if the first condition is satisfied. We look at the sequence of positive terms a1 = 1, a2 = ½, …, an = 1/n. Is it true that Yup; has the bigger denominator. And we check the second condition: So the alternating series test is satisfied, and the series converges. Note that this series is the alternating version of the harmonic series, which diverged. Just like a pair of siblings, one of whom turns out kind and sweet while the other is evil incarnate, the alternating harmonic series converges while the harmonic series blows up in your face. Example 2 Does converge? Solution Now we take . We check the first condition of the alternating series test. Is it true that This is certainly true for all n ≥",

ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE When someone is crazy, we call him nuts. When someone is loonier than a dentist on nitrous oxide, we call him absolutely nuts. When the terms of a series add up to a finite quantity, we call it convergent. But when the absolute values of its terms adds up to a finite quantity, we call it absolutely convergent. Absolute convergence is a stronger form of convergence. Definition A series is absolutely convergent if the series converges. For instance, is convergent and absolutely convergent, since is a p-series with p > 1 and 1/n2 is its own absolute value. On the other hand, is convergent but not absolutely convergent, as its absolute value gives the harmonic series. We call such a series conditionally convergent. Notice that if someone is absolutely nuts, then they are certainly nuts. The same holds true for convergence. Absolute Convergence Theorem If a series is absolutely convergent, it is convergent. In the case of a positive term series, this theorem says absolutely nothing, since the terms of the series don’t change when you take absolute values. But sometimes it’s quite useful. Example 3 The series is absolutely convergent, because taking the absolute value of its terms gives the series , which is a p-series with p = 2 > 1, and this series converges by the p-series test. So the original series is absolutely convergent and therefore convergent. Notice that we could have used the alternating series test to show it converged, but hey, why bother? We have better things to do. 4.9 More tests for convergence A man carries his dog into the vet’s office and says, “Doctor, you have to help me. My dog’s not well.” The vet lays the dog down on an examination table and puts a stethoscope to the dog’s chest. He sighs as he straightens up and says, “I’m sorry, sir, but your dog is dead.” “That can’t be,” says the man, completely distraught. “I want a second opinion.” “Okay,” shrugs the vet. He leaves the room only to return with a large tabby cat, which he sets down next to the dog on the examining table. The cat carefully sniffs the dog from head to tail and then meows at the vet. The vet says,\"The cat has confirmed it. The dog is dead.” “No,” says the man, desperate in his grief. “You are both wrong.” “Okay,” says the vet, and he goes out again, returning with a black labrador retriever. The lab puts his forepaws up on the examining table and nudges the dog with his nose several times, but the dog doesn’t budge. Then the lab barks at the vet. “Same diagnosis, I am afraid,” says the vet. Sobbing, the man says,\"Okay, okay, I believe you. What do I owe you?” “That’ll be $550,” says the vet. “What?” says the man. “That’s outrageous. Why so much?” “Well, look,” says the vet, “it’s $50 for my diagnosis. Then it’s $250 for the cat scan and $250 for the lab test.” Speaking of tests, the next one is perhaps the most commonly applied of them all. Ratio Test If is a series, then",

If kept under control, they can put out fires and disperse students rioting over low grades. But you don’t want to lose your grip on a firehose. If you do, run for cover, because they start flipping around like an eel plugged into an electrical outlet. In the case of power series, it is the values that we put in for x that determine whether or not the series is under control. Some values of x will cause the series to converge. But put in a wrong value and the series diverges, meaning it’s a firehose out of control. Run for cover. We call the values of x for which a power series converges its interval of convergence. Let’s look at some examples. Example 1 Determine the values of x for which the following series converges. Solution We apply the ratio test: It doesn’t matter what x is. The series converges for all values of x. Example 2 Determine the values of x for which the following series converges. Solution We apply the ratio test again: By the ratio test, if , the series will converge. So |x| < 3 gives convergence. If –3 < x < 3, the series definitely converges. For values of x < –3 and x > 3, the series definitely diverges. We still need to check what happens at x = 3 and x = –",

If we multiplied out each of the terms (x – a)2, (x – a)3, …, (x – a)n, and then cleaned up, we would have a polynomial that looked just like the first expression for f(x). But there are other less friendly functions. Functions that prefer to stay in the basement where no one will try to start up a conversation. Yes, we’re talking about sin x, ln x, ex and the like. And let’s not mention arctan x. Try asking ln x, “So, umm, what’s your value at 3?” You’ll get a response like, “Why do you want to know? What’s it to you? Why’re you prying into my affairs? You some kind of hot shot mathhead? Think you can just walk up here and with a little addition and multiplication, you have me figured out? Well, you’re out of luck, base 2 brain. It’s none of your exponential business what my value at 3 is. Now clear out of here, before I kick you in your tangenital component.” You get the idea, unfriendly.

In fact, why not do that? It’s not hard to see that if we continued to add terms in this example, we would find: This is a power series. It is called the Taylor series of sin x. When it converges, we can use it to get better and better approximations of our nasty function. But when our power series diverges, it’s completely useless. Hey, whatever tickles your troglodyte. 4.13 Taylor’s formula with remainder Now we get to the end, the remnant, the stuff that’s left over when everything else has been snapped up. Yes, it’s time for the remainder sale. Time to move out those Taylor series remainders. Although Taylor’s formula gives us a good approximation to f(x) near x = a, it’s not exact, and there is an error. And sometimes when we use Taylor’s formula we absolutely positively have to know how large the error can be. Otherwise, the bridge we designed almost holds cars. Or the new male contraceptive pill we have created almost prevents pregnancy. Fortunately, there is a simple method for bounding the error. If we take a degree n Taylor polynomial to approximate f(x) near x = a, we get: Taylor’s Formula with Remainder where c is some number between a and x. The quantity Rn(x) is the remainder, or error term. It’s the difference between the degree n Taylor polynomial at x, which is just an approximation, and the exact value f(x). Notice that it depends on some unidentified number c that lies somewhere between a and x. Unfortunately, when we use Taylor approximations, and we want to know how big the possible error is, we don’t know which c gives the precise error. So the procedure is to bound the value of Rn(x) for any value of c between a and x and therefore get a bound on how bad the error could possibly be.

And speaking of remainders, did you hear about the two student entrepeneurs from the Math Club who bet their year’s tuition that red T-shirts covered with yellow calculus equations would be the big fashion hit on campus that spring? They put all the the funds their parents had sent together with all they could borrow to purchase a mountain of T-shirts. Unfortunately, the end of winter classes came without any orders. Despite a massive ad campaign in the college paper, the phone failed to ring even once. Unsold T-shirts (remainders) filled their dorm room. Without money for tuition, ruin was imminent. Then, a week before fees were due, the phone rang. “This is Bud from the college bookstore” says the voice at the other end. “Hey, word has it that you have red T-shirts with some yellow equations on them. We could use them for our spring promotion. We can pay top dollar.” Bud mentioned a massive sum of money, but with one caveat. “I just have to clear it with purchasing because it’s such a big amount. If you don’t hear from me by 5 p.m. Friday, it’s a done deal.” The two students couldn’t believe their luck. They sat around nervously as the clock moved toward 5 p.m. Friday, just praying they wouldn’t get a call. At 4:55 p.m. the phone rang. Nervously, her heart beating furiously, one of the students picked up the phone. Then, slowly, as she listened, a smile crossed her face. “Good news,” she said. “Your car is on fire.” 4.14 Some famous Taylor series We have already mentioned a few of the most famous Taylor series. For instance, and In fact, we can manipulate Taylor series just like functions in order to generate other series. For instance, since cos x can be obtained by differentiating sin x, a Taylor series for cos x can be obtained by differentiating the Taylor series for sin x term by term. The result is What other basic Taylor series do we have? Let’s go back to geometric series for just a second. Remember that when |r| < 1, we knew that the geometric series converged to . Letting a = 1 and replacing r with the variable x, we have So this is a series representation of . In fact, it agrees with what we would obtain by applying Taylor’s formula.

The charges were serious, and could lead to expulsion. The hearing room was so quiet you could hear an epsilon drop. “It’s really not my fault. You see, I didn’t actually take the test. It was my alternate personality, Fred. He knows about double and triple integrals, but I don’t.” There was pandemonium in the courtroom. Barney was claiming multiple integral disorder. In order to make sure this never happens to you, let’s learn about multiple integrals. Just what are multiple integrals? In brief, a multiple integral is a limit of a Riemann sum over a region in the plane or in space. Huh, what? Maybe that’s a little too brief. Let’s think back to what integrals really are. In a word, they’re about multiplication. We use an integral to calculate area (width × height), work (force × distance), revenue (units sold × price), etc. Now we learned how to multiply two numbers by third grade, but with integration we can multiply more interesting things. With integrals we can calculate area (width × height) not just when the height is constant, but also when the height is varying from point to point. We can calculate work done (force × distance) not just when the force is constant and we move in a straight line, but also when the force is varying from point to point and the path is bending every which way. We do this by breaking everything up into tiny pieces, so that over each piece the height or force or direction of motion is close to constant. Then we can do our multiplication for each piece just as in third grade, and then add everything up. Finally, we take a limit to see what happens as the pieces get really tiny, and this turns the sum into an integral. We’ve seen this done for functions of one variable f(x), but it works just as well with functions of several variables f(x, y) or f(x, y, z), giving rise to multiple integrals. Going from calculating area to calculating volume is the best illustration of how it all works. To get the area of a rectangle, we multiply its width times its height. To find the area under a curve y = f(x) between x = a and x = b, we saw in first-semester calculus that we can break [a, b] into lots of small intervals of length Δxi. Then we can form a rectangle over each interval with height f(xi) where xi is a point in the ith interval. The area of each rectangle is f(xi)·Δxi. Adding up these areas gives an approximation to the area under the curve, as in Figure 9.1a. When we take the limit as the number of intervals goes to infinity, we get an integral that gives the total area exactly. We can use the same ideas to calculate volumes. Just as area is a limit of the areas of a bunch of thin rectangles, so volume is a limit of the sum of the volumes of a bunch of thin boxes. The volume of a box is given by area of base × height. To calculate the volume under z = f(x, y) over a region R in the xy-plane, we break the region R into lots of tiny rectangles of size Δx by Δy. The area of each little rectangle is Δx · Δy, or ΔA for short. We form a box above each tiny rectangle with base the rectangle and height f(x, y), where (x, y) is some point in the rectangle. The volume of the box is f(x, y) · ΔA. Then we add up all the volumes of the skinny boxes as in Figure 9.1b. If we take a limit as the number of boxes goes to infinity, we get the exact volume under the surface. The same idea shows up when calculating lots of other quantities, like total mass (volume × density), total rainfall (area × rainfall in that area), etc. The main idea behind multiple integrals is this process of breaking up a region into a bunch of tiny regions where a function is pretty much constant, and multiplying the area of each by the value of the function there. Figure 9.1 Cutting an area into skinny rectangles and a volume into skinny boxes. The other thing we’ll need to understand is how to calculate these gadgets. We’ll see how to compute a double integral by doing two single integrals of the type we know well, and a triple integral by doing three. Except for a few technicalities, we already know how to calculate multiple integrals. 9.1 Double integrals and limits—the technical stuff The precise meaning of the double integral is given by a Riemann sum type formula: This may look scary, but it’s just a repeat of the ideas in the Riemann sum. We break the region R, called the base, into a lot of little rectangles of area ΔAi and in each one we pick a point (xi, yi). Each little rectangle will form the base of a rectangular box. The value of f at (xi, yi) will be the height of the corresponding box. The volume of the box is then given by f(xi, yi) ΔAi. The sum of all these volumes of slender boxes Figure 9.2 A box of height f(xi, yi) above each little rectangle. gives an approximation to the volume we are after. See Figure 9.",

    "content": "This approximately gives the double integral when the number of little rectangles n is large. Taking the limit as R is divided into more and smaller rectangles, whose number n → ∞ gives the double integral . Technical Point The limits may not exist if the function f(x, y) is very nasty, or if the region R is exotic. For functions f(x, y) which are continuous, and for functions we are likely to encounter our first time through calculus, this issue won’t come up. The interpretation of double integral as a volume holds when the function f(x, y) is positive. So now we know, technically speaking, what double integrals are. What remains to be seen is How to calculate them What they’re good for 9.2 Calculating double integrals The method for calculating multiple integrals can be summarized in a word—iterate. The simplest type of region R lies between two vertical lines x = a and x = b, and also between two graphs, below y = g2(x) and above y = g1(x), as in Figure 9.3a. Such an R is called vertically simple. The key to being a vertical simpleton is that over all values of x, the top function never changes, in this case it’s always g2(x), and the bottom function never changes, in this case it’s always g1(x). Another way to put it is that for every vertical line in the xy-plane that intersects the region, as we travel up the line, we hit each curve once, and we always hit the curve y = g1(x) first and y = g2(x) second. Figure 9.3 Vertically simple regions. Vertical simpletons can also look like Figure 9.3b, where the values of a and b happen to occur where the two graphs intersect. With this type of region we write the double integral as It’s calculated by doing two integrations, called an iterated integral. This means that we do the inner integral first: treating x not as a variable, but just as some constant that’s hanging around, like a sofa. Once we’ve done the inner integral, x gets promoted back to a variable. With x a variable we get a function of x, which we then proceed to integrate with respect to x. We always start with the inner integral and work our way out. A multiple-integral problem, like the problem of losing unsightly fat, is solved by working out. The limits on the inner integral are called the inner limits and the limits on the outer integral are called the outer limits. Example 1 Compute Solution The region in the xy-plane that we are integrating over is bounded below by y = x and above by y = x2, to the left by x = 1 and to the right by x =",

If you do this, the final answer might not turn out to be a number, but could have x’s or y’s in it. That’s bad. Really bad. Always remember to work from the inside integral out. Important Factoid The outer limits are always constants. (A factoid is something that is either a fact, or if it isn’t, should be.) Why should they be constants? If not, the result of taking the iterated integral would have variables in it since, at the end, we plug in the outer limits.

Now it’s true that most people don’t slice their pizza into long thin pieces, but they might if they had a good set of ginsu knives. We now compute the integral starting with the inner one and working our way out: The trickier part of calculating double integrals often comes before we actually do any integration. We need to describe the region R correctly, and get the limits of integration set up. This is relatively easy for regions that are vertically or horizontally simple. But a person who is deep and complicated would never be called a simpleton, either vertical or horizontal. Similarly, a region that is complicated enough may be neither a vertical nor horizontal simpleton. What do we do if we need to compute a double integral over such a region?

What really concerns them is their volume. They wouldn’t care that they weighed 500 pounds if they look trim and fit, with abs of steel. Picture these people—with muscles rippling over bodies that don’t show an iota of fatty tissue. Such people probably walk around wearing just the tiniest bikinis, because after all that working out, they’re going to strut their stuff. But suppose their bones are made of lead and they weigh in at half a ton. Do they care? Not in the least.

Common Mistake Always make sure f(x, y) is positive over the region R when calculating a volume. Just as with areas, if part of the graph dips below the xy-plane, then integration over the corresponding subregion will contribute a negative quantity to the total volume. The integral will no longer represent a volume, but rather the sum of “signed” volumes. 9.4 Double integrals in polar coordinates When we are dealing with regions bounded by circles, it is often easier to work with polar coordinates. In this setting, points are described by (r, θ) rather than (x, y), and the area of a tiny region is not dx · dy but rather r dr dθ. The radian measure of angle has the nice property that the length of a piece of a circle of radius r sweeping out an angle of Δθ is r Δθ. In Figure 9.10, a small wedge in which the radius changes from r to r + Δr and the angle changes from θ to θ + Δθ has area approximately Δr · r Δθ. The extra r-factor comes about because one side of the wedge has length about r Δθ rather than just Δθ. Figure 9.10 The area of a little wedge is approximately r Δr Δθ. So in polar coordinates the double integral becomes Important Fact to Remember: Every double integral in polar coordinates will have that extra factor of r that multiplies dr dθ. Computing double integrals in polar coordinates is done by iterating two single integrals, just as before. Example 1 Calculate the integral of the function f(x, y) = x2 + y2 over the region inside the circle of radius 2 and outside the circle of radius 1, centered at the origin. Solution Polar coordinates really pay off here. Without them we would have a pretty hard time describing the region R, shown in Figure 9.",

Let’s use a double integral to find the volume of the top half of the cored apple and then double the result. The volume that we want will be the solid that is under the surface and above the region in the xy-plane inside the circle r = 2 and outside the circle r = 1, so we do not include the core. The total volume of the cored apple is given by Figure 9.12 Finding the volume of a cored apple. The inner r-integral can be done by a u-substitution with u = 4 – r2, and we get In order to get a volume of 150 cubic inches of apple per pie, it looks like you need about seven apples per pie.

She got intense pleasure from calculating areas, and when she was introduced to integration by parts her ecstasy knew no end. But after a while she stopped feeling the old buzz, and even antiderivatives of inverse hyperbolic functions got stale. She considered studying physics and in a moment of despair, even psychology. But then, a junior math major turned her on to double integrals and the old thrill returned. She was calculating areas, volumes, masses. It was a kick for a while. But soon they, too, were not enough. She had heard about something stronger, but dangerous. “Don’t go near that stuff,” her Calc I instructor had warned in his nasal voice. “Once you get into it, you never give it up.” But she couldn’t help herself. She had to try it. The house was in the seedy part of town. She saw teaching assistants and postdocs sprawled in doorways amid scraps of paper and old calculus texts. The address had been given to her by a wild-eyed, decrepit senior who, unless he entered treatment soon, would probably be headed for graduate school. Looking furtively over her shoulder, she passed her few remaining dollars through the slot in the door, trembling in anticipation of the final step on her journey: the triple integral. Okay, so maybe integrals aren’t mind bending enough to be smuggled in on speedboats, but triple integrals do take the idea of double integrals one step further. To compute an integral over a region in 3-space, we iterate as before, but one extra time. Triple integrals in xyz-coordinates are written like: They take their precise meaning from a Riemann sum: where this time V is a solid region in three-dimensional space and the Vi are little boxes with volume ΔVi. It’s sometimes tricky to draw a picture of the solid V in 3-space. But it is almost always necessary to sketch the solid in order to determine the correct limits of integration. Figure 9.13 A solid V in 3-space bounded by the graphs of two functions over a region R in the xy-plane. The most basic type of solid V is sandwiched between two surfaces, each a graph over a region in the plane, as in Figure 9.",

You could say, “Meet me at 40 degrees 45 minutes latitude, 74 degrees 13 minutes longitude.” Most people don’t respond well to those directions, with some exceptions in the sailor community. Or you could say, “Go down Loblolly Street until you see the Citgo Station, take a right at the third light after that, not including the two blinking lights, then at the second oak tree veer to the left (but not all the way to the left) onto Shrinkwrap Way, and the second restaurant on the left is the place.” Both describe the same destination, but in different coordinates. Similarly, we can have more than one description of a point in 3-space. We’re already very comfortable with rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinates. But just as polar coordinates were sometimes just the thing to solve two-dimensional problems, there are times when it pays to look at alternative coordinate systems in 3-space. You may say, “Now why is this the time? I’m very happy working with the rectangular coordinate system. Why make my life difficult?” If you did say that, shame! We’re hurt. Hey, we’ve stayed up late worrying that maybe some topic could be rewritten just for you, spent long hours thinking about how to make things clear. Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems will make your life easier. At certain critical moments you’ll be so glad to see them, you would kiss their feet in gratitude—if they had any. CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES Cylindrical coordinates are really easy. All we do is use polar coordinates in the plane and add a regular old z-coordinate. In cylindrical coordinates, a point is identified by (r, θ, z), where r and θ tell you where to go in the xy-plane and the z-coordinate tells how far to go above or below that point. So, for instance, (r, θ, z) = (2, π/4,",

Now project the line segment into the xy-plane and define the angle of that projected line segment with the positive x-axis to be θ. This θ is the same as our old pal from cylindrical coordinates.

So Anytime we have an integral in spherical coordinates, we automatically stick in the ρ2 sin φ dρ dφ dθ for dV. Example 6 (Eliminating Air Pollution) The Xtilploth aliens are siphoning off the Earth’s atmosphere to take to their own oxygen-depleted world. They need to calculate the atmosphere’s total mass to figure out how long it will take to them to tow it home. For rough estimation, they assume the Earth is a sphere of radius 6,400,000 meters, and that the density of air h meters above the ground is kilograms per cubic meter. (Note: Don’t use this in your meteorology class, it’s not even close. But hey, they’re aliens, who can fathom how they come up with these functions?) If they take all of the atmosphere up to a height of 20 kilometers, what is the total mass of the air they tug home? Solution We calculate the total mass of the atmosphere by integrating its density. (More on that in the next section.) This is best done in spherical coordinates. We’ll measure everything in meters and kilograms. The region we want to integrate over is described in spherical coordinates as having 6,400,000 ≤ ρ ≤ 6,420,000 (6400 to 6420 kilometers from the center of Earth) 0 ≤ φ ≤ π and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π Since h = ρ – 6,400,000, the function we integrate is which gives the atmosphere’s density at a point (ρ, φ, θ). So the triple integral we want is Doing this integral from the inside out, we find: This is too much mass for them to drag home in time. No problem, though. They sent it air freight. 9.7 Mass, center of mass, and moments In math and physics, we often pretend that a messily shaped object is just a single point. If we sling a cow across a pasture using a catapult, and we want to make sure it will land in the pond and not on the local supermarket, then it doesn’t make too much difference if we assume the cow is a point, with all of its mass centered at that point. What is important is to know the total mass of the cow and the so-called center of mass of the cow. MASS First, how to find the mass of a cow V (stands for “veal”)? Suppose that the cow’s density is not uniform. Certain parts of the cow are denser than other parts. And suppose that the density of the cow at a point (x, y, z) is given by σ(x, y, z). Then if we cut the cow up into lots of little boxes (not literally, just figuratively; we’re not Oscar Meyer), the mass of a box is approximately the density at some point in the box times the volume of the box. Adding up the masses of all these boxes and taking a limit as the number of boxes goes up and the size of the boxes goes down, we get an integral: Notice that when the density σ(x, y, z) = 1, then the mass is just equal to the volume. CENTER OF MASS The center of mass is also called the centroid, and to understand it, let’s return to the childhood days you spent at the playground. Remember how your favorite thing in the world was to get on one end of a seesaw, with Bobby Rensputter at the other end, and to slowly bounce up and down, while singing “See-Saw, marjory daw, the pumpkin went to the market” or some such ditty, until Bobby was lulled into a false sense of security. And then when he was right at the highest point, you rolled off your end of the seesaw and watched in delight as that look of despair crossed his face and he plummeted to the teeth-jarring finale. Yes, childhood was a constant parade of delights. And those experiences on the seesaw taught you something about the mechanics of balancing and fulcrums. They also taught Bobby Rensputter about the darker side of human nature. But let’s stick to what you learned. THEORY OF SEESAWS Suppose that one of the players from the offensive front line of the Green Bay Packers sits down on a reinforced seesaw at x1, with a member of the New York City Ballet at the other end at x",

Solving that equation for , we get The coordinate of the balance point is obtained by taking a weighted sum of the masses divided by the total mass. The masses are each weighted by their respective coordinate. For a whole bunch of masses, say n, the formula would be Now this is just on a line, but the same rule applies for the y- and z-coordinates when our particles are distributed in space. The point (, , ) is called the centroid, or center of mass, of the n particles. Our next goal is to find the center of mass of any old solid body V. The idea for finding it is to cut up the body into little bits, and treat them as a whole lot of points whose center of mass we want to find. To compute the mass of a little box in the region, we need to know the distribution of mass in the region, which is given by a density function σ(x, y, z). We multiply the volume of that region (dxdydz after a limit) by the density σ(x, y, z). This leads us to three integral formulas: Notice that in all three cases, the triple integral in the denominator is just the mass of the solid. The point (, , ) is the center of mass of the body, and it’s right where all the mass would balance if we hung that region from a string. Because we multiply the density function by the first power of x, y, or z to calculate these, the integrals in the numerator are called the first moments of the object. This does not refer to when the object was born. Trick We can often use symmetry to simplify center of mass calculations. If the body you are looking at looks exactly the same when you switch x and –x and the density function σ is unchanged by this switch, then the x-coordinate of the center of mass must be zero. Similarly for y and z. Example 1 Find the centroid of the solid with constant density σ(x, y, z) = 1 that is bounded by the graphs of z = x2 + y2 and z =",

That instant when the person you had a crush on in calculus class passed you in the hall and looked right at you, eyes like rayguns firing deep into your soul. There was a split second of opportunity, which if seized, could have led to a tandem bicycle for two down the road of life. You wanted to say, “Hi, I’m that person who stares at the back of your head all class long.” But what came out was a garbled, “Egurrhhh.” You watched horrified as your potential soulmate walked off with a confused backward glance. The bicycle built for two careened wildly into a ditch. That was your “moment of inertia,” a term very familiar to those in the “hard” sciences. But we want to talk about another type of moment of inertia. Class Demonstration Split up into pairs. Pick up your neighbor and twirl him or her around in the air. Be careful not to let go. Note that it’s hard work to get the motion going at first, but once you get your partner spinning good, with feet up in the air, it’s not so bad. The resistance to getting a body twirling is what the moment of inertia measures. For a particle, the moment of inertia is given by mr2, where m is the mass and r is the distance to the axis we are swinging the particle around. Because we multiply the mass by the second power of r to calculate this, it’s also called the second moment of the object. To calculate the moment of inertia for an object which fills up a solid V, we cut it up into tiny little boxes. The mass per unit volume at a point is given by a function called the mass density, so the mass of a tiny box is approximated well by multiplying its volume by the mass density. The moment of inertia of the tiny box is then its mass times the square of its distance from the axis. As usual, this results in an integral. Let’s say we are rotating around the z-axis. Then the square of the distance from the axis is given by x2 + y2 and the moment of inertia of a solid V with mass density σ(x, y, z) is or in cylindrical coordinates, Besides calculating the amount of energy needed to start an engine turning, the moment of inertia is also important in the study of animal tipping.

We can choose any order to do multiple integrals, and this one is best suited for this problem. Then the integral equals That’s a lot of inertia. She’d better get some well-oiled ball bearings if she wants to get that chicken spinning. 9.8 Change of coordinates We have already seen how to calculate multiple integrals in polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. But there are an unlimited number of different coordinate systems possible. You can even make your own up. But how do we decide what replaces dV = dx dy dz in some random coordinate system? If we want to do integration in these new coordinates, we are going to need to know that. Luckily, there is a simple formula which tells us. Suppose that a point in space is described by coordinates u, v, and w, rather than the usual rectangular coordinates x, y, and z. The new coordinates are related to x, y, z by equations x = x(u, v, w), y = y(u, v, w), z = z(u, v, w). Then the formula for the triple integral of a function f(x, y, z), ∫∫∫V f(x, y, z) dV will be replaced by ∫∫∫V f(u, v, w) dV. What we need to do is to express dV in our new coordinates, by finding the volume of a small box-shaped region in the u-, v-, w-coordinate system. Set the vector r to be xi + yj + zk. Then r = x(u, v, w)i + y(u, v, w)j + z(u, v, w)k. The volume of a small box in u-, v-, w-coordinates is given approximately by the scalar triple product of the vectors The formula for dV is given by the scalar triple product of these, or The last expression is just a shorthand way of writing this. This determinant is called the Jacobian; it measures the volume stretching factor of u, v, w compared to x, y, z. The triple integral in u-, v-, w-coordinates is then written as V will be described using the u-, v-, w-coordinates which correspond to the region we are integrating over. Note that this is not the same as the description of that region in x-, y-, z-coordinates. Example 1 (Feet and Yard Coordinates) The cubicles smelled. Too many people had been eating too many late-night snacks and stuffing the garbage behind a neighbor’s desk. So everyone was required to measure the size of his or her own cubicles in cubic feet, and buy enough air freshener to get rid of the odor. Air freshener costs $5 per cubic foot (the strong stuff), so most people described their cubicles in units of feet and integrated the function f(x, y, z) = 5 over the region describing their cubicle to calculate the cost of the air freshener they needed. As usual however, Amy did things differently. Amy always insisted on measuring in yards rather than feet. Her cubicle S, in the usual x-, y-, z-foot coordinates, was the region 0 ≤ x ≤ 6, 0 ≤ y ≤ 6, 0 ≤ z ≤ 6 (cubical of course). But using yard coordinates (u, v, w), with x = 3u, y = 3v, and w = 3z, Amy measured the cubicle as 0 ≤ u ≤ 2, 0 ≤ v ≤ 2, 0 ≤ w ≤",

They don’t understand the vodka-drinking potential of our readers. Anyway, a series Σ an converges absolutely if its absolute value Σ |an| converges. This is at least as difficult to achieve as convergence of the original series, so absolute convergence implies convergence. A series which is convergent but not absolutely convergent is called conditionally convergent. Acceleration Vector The derivative of the velocity vector or the second derivative of the position vector. Its length tells you how fast speed is changing. Useful when shmoozing another driver at a red light. “I was so impressed with your acceleration vector back there.” Arc Length Reputed by Noah to have come in at 300 cubits. To calculate the length of a parametrized curve, we compute a line integral. The quantity d s that we integrate to get the length is called the element of arc length. For a parametrized curve the element of arc length is , and the length of the curve is Cardioid Derogatory name for a professional greeting card designer. Also a heart-shaped graph which in polar coordinates is given by equations like r = 1 + cos θ or r = 1 + sin θ. Cardioid Arrest Happens to the hearts of those who open up the final and haven’t read this book. Center of Mass That spot right in the center of your belly after a massive Thanksgiving dinner. As you move, it moves, too, but more slowly. For a two-dimensional flat object, the point on which it can be balanced. For a three-dimensional solid object, if you slice the object along any plane through this point, the two sides balance each other. Centroid Fancy name for the center of mass. Also a unit of currency in Detroid. Chain Rule (for Functions of Several Variables) A rule known to teenagers who look like they’ve been attacked by a staple gun. Also a way of taking the derivative of composite functions such as f(g(x, y), h(x, y)), which are themselves functions of more than one variable. Conditional Convergence The kind of joining in holy matrimony where one person proposes by saying, “If you want to marry rich old me, you must sign a prenup.” Also, a series with some terms possibly negative, which converges. The key example is the series 1 – ½ + ⅓ – ¼ + ··· which converges conditionally but not absolutely.

This can be easily evaluated: Cross Product A very grumpy product, probably because its formula is so much more complicated than the dot product’s. But the cross product of two vectors is a vector, not a number, so it has to have a lot of coordinates. When v = v1, v2, v3 and w = w1, w2, w3, then v × w = (v2w3 – v3w2)i + (v3w1 – v1w3)j + (v1w2 – v2w1)k. Remember this using a determinant formula: Curl What happens to your hair when you see a Stokes’s theorem problem on the final. But no need to panic, just remember that curl measures the tendency of a vector field to spin around an axis. For a vector field V in 3-space, curl V is a vector field, too. At a particular point in space, the vector field curl V lines up along the axis where the most spinning around is taking place and its length gives the amount of spinning. More spinning, bigger curl. The direction that curl V points along the axis of maximal rotation is given by the right-hand rule. Well, with all that, there’s a simple formula to calculate curl V : curl V = × V Curvature Derived from “curvy chair,” a chair style out of the nineteenth century’s premodern school. Winner of many design awards, its adoption was hampered by its tendency to flip upside down when someone sat in it. Also a measure κ(t) of the bending of a parametrized curve r(t). Curvature tells us how quickly the unit tangent vector to the curve, is changing direction. For a unit speed curve r(s) the unit tangent vector is just r’(s) and the formula for κ(s) is The curvature of an arbitrary curve r(t) is given by Cylindrical Coordinates A hybrid. Just take polar coordinates r and θ in the plane and tack on a z from rectangular coordinates. Looks like a Volkswagon with the hood from a Cadillac. Del The symbol is called del, and stands for is an operator—by itself doesn’t really mean anything, but f is the gradient of a function f(x, y, z), ·F is the divergence of the vector field F and × F is the curl of the vector field F. Just as you can’t get a good sandwich until you add an “i” to “del” to get deli, so you have to add a function or vector field to Del to get a meaningful result. Determinant A number associated to a square array of numbers. Very useful in calculating the cross product of two vectors. Differential Equation An equation that contains derivatives, such as . Despite their names, these equations are often very rude, not deferential at all. Direction Angles The best angles at which to get a closeup when shooting a calculus movie. Contact authors if interested in this book’s movie rights. Also, if we pick an arbitrary direction in space, the angles α, β, and γ between that direction and the x-, y-, and z-axes are called the direction angles. Direction of Steepest Ascent/Descent The compass direction in which you should head in order to go up or down a hill the steepest way possible. The vector f points in the direction of steepest ascent and –f points in the direction of steepest descent. So you should not head in the direction of –f when standing on the edge of a cliff. Directional Derivative Men never ask for these. The directional derivative of a function f(x, y) in the direction of a unit vector u is by Duf = f · u Divergence, or diV Two paths diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and got the wrong answer. The divergence of a vector field F at a point is a number which measures the amount by which the vector field is compressing or expanding at that point. The formula is div F = · f Divergence Theorem The divergence theorem in the plane states that if you add up (by integrating) the divergence of a vector field in a region in the plane (measuring its overall total expansion or compression in the region), you get the total flow of the vector field across the boundary, called the flux. Extremely useful if you are in the process of spilling large quantities of maple syrup onto a raised stage with limited drainage. The version for 3-space says that the total divergence of the vector field in a region in 3-space equals the flow across the surface which is the boundary of the region. Continuity is needed for F and div F. Dot Product Early internet startup, crashed and burned. Also a way of getting a number by taking a product of two vectors which measures how much they line up; it is the product of their lengths times the cosine of the angle between them. Very useful because of its supereasy formula, which makes it a cinch to calculate. When v = v1, v2, v3 and w = w1, w2, w3, then v · w = v1w1 + v2w2 + v3w3 It works just the same for vectors with more or less components. Double Integral Served with ice, it’s a favorite cocktail drink at math parties, right up there with the Pink Lagrange Multiplier. Also an iterated integral, performed twice. When you see you should think of doing two ordinary integrals, starting with the inside one and continuing by plugging the answer from that one into the outside limits. The inner limits can be functions but the outer limits are almost always constants. Ellipsoid Object removed during elliposuction. Also the surface which looks like a deformed sphere, and whose equations are Flux State of your calculus knowledge—usually increasing, sometimes decreasing, but in a state of change. Also a measure of the amount of a vector field that is flowing through a surface. At each point in the surface, the flux is given by V · n, where V is a vector field and n is the unit vector perpendicular to the surface at that point. Actually, there are two unit vectors, and we must choose a direction perpendicular to the surface, or an orientation, to calculate the flux. The total flux of a vector field through a surface is related to the divergence of the vector field integrated over the region inside the surface by the divergence theorem. Geometric Series A series of the form a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + ···. Converges to if |r| < 1 and diverges otherwise. Great for modeling distance traveled by bouncing balls. Gradient, or grad Good with turkey and mashed potatients. The gradient of a function f(x, y, z) is a vector in space: Green’s Theorem Version 1: Most environmental activists drive SUVs, have redwood decks, and use disposable diapers, even if they don’t have kids. Version 2: In the plane, Green’s theorem tells us a way to calculate the line integral around a closed curve, when we go around it counterclockwise. If F = Pi + Qj is a vector field and C goes around a region R, then Continuity is needed for P, Q, and their derivatives. Harmonic Series 1 + ½ + ⅓ + ···. One of the great series of our times. Although the terms get smaller and smaller, the series does NOT converge. Hyperboloid Very active boloid, can’t keep still. Also the surface which looks like a hyperbola spun around an axis, and whose equations are like the typical example: x2 + y2 – z2 = 1 Indeterminate Form What you use to file your income taxes. Also a limit which approaches or . Great opportunity to use L’Hôpital’s rule. Infinite Sequence Not to be confused with infinite sequins, garments worn by pianists in Las Vegas. An infinite sequence is an unending list of numbers. The most famous is 1, 2, 3, 4, … but 2, 4, 6, 8, … and 1, 4, 9, 16, … are good examples, too. Lagrange Multipliers A pocket tool which performs 45 functions. Also a technique for solving constrained max-min problems that’s useful in a variety of disciplines, particularly economics where investments are constrained by the total capital available, unless you’re Bill Gates. When maximizing f holding g constant, find the points where f is a constant multiple of g. This will give the points where f is maximized or minimized subject to the constraint. Line Integral An integral of a function defined on a parametrized curve in space or in the plane. Maclaurin Series Power series which looks like Can be used to approximate a function f(x) by a polynomial near x =",

Spherical Coordinates Alternate coordinates for 3-space where ρ is the length of the line segment from you back to the origin, φ is the angle of that line segment with the positive z-axis, and θ is the angle between the projection of the segment to the xy-plane and the positive x-axis. People who believe in the mystical power of pyramid-shaped crystals tend to give their coordinates in spherical, often with a reincarnated spirit named Ocnomon at the origin. Stokes’s Theorem A theorem celebrated each October with Stokestoberfest, wherein lots of Bavarians drink gallons of beer in a roped-off area called a beergarden D. As they drink, they sing and dance, with a lot of spinning, which puts tremendous strain on the rope C. The theorem says: There’s also a version for 3-space. Different Stokes for different folks. Here we look at a surface S hanging around in space whose edge, or boundary, is a curve called C. Take F to be a vector field on S and call the unit normal vector n. The theorem equates a line integral over the curve C and a surface integral over S: The total twisting effect of the vector field over the surface S is equal to the total tangential part of the vector field along the curve C. In both versions continuity is needed for F and curl F. Surface Integral Some integrals have complex personalities, but to the world at large they show a superficial persona, never hinting at the deep struggles which consume them. These integrals allow us to calculate quantities associated to surfaces in space. To calculate an integral of a function on a surface, we use a double integral involving the element of surface area dS. Tangent Line to a Parametrized Curve Where tangents go to get their cars registered, buy stamps, or check in their luggage. Also a line which approximates a curve r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) near a point r(t0). Given by the parametric equation or by the equation Tangent Plane A plane in space that is parallel to a surface r(u, v) in space at a given point x0, y0, z0 = r(u0, v0), approximating the surface near that point as best as any plane can. Use the cross product to get a normal vector n = ru × rv at the point (x0, y0, z0). Then the equation of the plane is Tangenital Component A particularly unfortunate misspelling of tangential component, which is that part of a vector that is in the direction of the tangent to a curve. Often applied to the acceleration vector, where the tangential component measures how fast the speed is changing. Taylor Series The finals in the alteration competition at the Tailor’s Olympics. Also the infinite series associated to a function f(x) and a point x = a. A finite number of terms give a way to approximate f(x). The error can be bounded using Taylor’s remainder formula. Triple Integral As triple play is to double play, so triple integral is to double integral. You do the same sort of thing but one more time. You calculate these by iterating the integral process three times, starting with the inside and working out. Triple Scalar Product Ice cream treat sometimes served in the calculus lounge. Also a way of multiplying three vectors u, v, w to get a number which is the volume of the parallelepiped they span. Calculated by taking (u × v) · w. Velocity Vector A vector which gives the speed and direction of a particle moving along a parametrized path r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t). The formula is simple: Zeno The last entry in any dictionary of calculus terms. Zeno was a Greek philosopher best known for Zeno’s paradox. He pointed out that for a runner to go a mile, first she must go half the distance, then half the remaining distance, then half the remaining distance ad infinitum. Since clearly the runner cannot perform an infinite number of steps in a finite amount of time, motion is an impossiblility and is therefore an illusion. We ended our last book by saying that therefore all the world is just a dream and you should roll over and go back to sleep. However, in this book we have seen that an infinite number of distances can add up to a finite quantity. In fact, ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + ··· = 1 mile. So much for Zeno’s paradox. Wake up and smell the coffee.",

Triple integrals over a solid region V take the form * Mass, Center of Mass, and Moments: The mass of a region V is obtained by integrating the density function σ over a region. The center of mass of V, also called the centroid, is a point (, , ) where a solid “balances.” Its coordinates are given by The integrals in the numerator are called the first moments of V. * The moment of inertia of a solid V measures the resistance to getting it twirling. For twirling around the z-axis, it’s given by * Change of Coordinates: When we use some coordinates (u, v, w) other than the rectangular coordinates (x, y, z), we have to adapt our formula for the multiple integral over a region. If we express each of x, y, z as a function of (u, v, w), so x = x(u, v, w), y = y(u, v, w), z = z(u, v, w), then let The triple integral in u-, v-, w-coordinates over a region V is Vector Fields, Div, and Curl: * A vector field in the plane gives a vector at each point in the plane, and looks like W(x, y) = P(x, y)i + Q(x, y)j.

These will be useful for a variety of purposes, particularly for describing curves in space. Our previous look at functions resembled the study of a lazy pet dog. We fed it a number and it drooled out an answer (another number) onto the carpet. But now we’ll look at a function with values in space. This is more like a cobra. We feed it a number, but it doesn’t just dribble out a number for an answer. It shoots a stream of venom straight toward our eyes—in other words, it produces a vector. 6.1 Parametric curves One of the many famous musical pieces about parametric curves is “The Flight of the Bumblebee,” composed by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov. After listening to the piece, it is clear that Rimsky-Korsakov must have derived precise mathematical equations describing a bee’s flight as it traveled from flower to flower collecting pollen, and then set the equations to music. [Editor’s note: There has been no independent verification of this theory. Most likely, they made this up, too.] You, too, can compose beautiful parametric curves. In fact, we have already done this when we described lines. For example, suppose we have a line given by the parametric equations We can express all three equations in a single vector-valued function of t given by The equations for x, y, and z become the x-, y-, and z-components of the vector. As t varies, r(t) gives different points along the line, as in Figure 6.",

As t increases, the first two coordinates wind around a circle, sin t, cos t, while the third coordinate increases steadily. This leads to a curve called a helix, which plays a starring role in your genes, where it models the shape of your DNA. (See Figure 6.2.) More generally, any vector-valued function with three components can be written in the form r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t). In most cases, computers give the best ways of drawing these curves. This being calculus, we’re going to differentiate these babies. Figure 6.2 A parametrized curve called the helix. DIFFERENTIATING VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS The way to do this couldn’t be easier. We just differentiate each of the components x(t), y(t), and z(t). The vector r’(t) is called the velocity vector to the curve at time t, or sometimes the tangent vector, since if we draw it starting at the point on the curve where we computed it, it is tangent to the curve and pointing in the direction of motion. (See Figure 6.3.) Notice that the derivative is a vector, not a number! To see how our position changes as we move along a curve, we need a direction AND a number that tells us how fast we are moving in that direction. In other words, we need a vector. The number |r’(t)|, the magnitude of the velocity vector, tells us how fast we are moving in the direction of the vector. It is called the speed.

Figure 6.3 The velocity vector r’(t) is tangent to the curve at r(t). RULES TO DIFFERENTIATE CURVES BY There are a variety of rules for differentiating dot products, cross products, etc., of vector-valued functions. They work just like the product, chain, and sum rules for functions. There are several types of multiplication that can be done: scalar multiplication, dot products, cross products. The appropriate version of the product rule works for all of them. For understanding these rules, keep in mind that r(t) and s(t) are vector-valued functions of t, where t is just a real variable like x or y. The function f(t) is a plain old real-valued function of t, or a scalar function as it’s sometimes called in vector calculus. Last, and maybe least, is c, which is just a constant real number. The last one is the chain rule for vector-valued functions. INTEGRATING VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS Integration of a vector-valued function r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) is also done term by term. When the integral is not a definite integral, a constant is tacked onto the end, just like in regular integration, only this time the constant is a vector: Example 2 A mosquito starts at time t = 0 at the point (1, 1, 1).

Your global positioning system tells you where you are at any time. You do some loop de loops, some wing salutes, some stomach-turning maneuvers. As you gracefully land the plane, your copilot looks up from the airsickness bag and asks, “So just how far did we go anyway?” You now have a typical arc-length problem. What is the length of the curve you traced out as you flew your plane around? To understand this question, we first have to realize how little we knew about measuring lengths before we learned calculus. The only things whose lengths we really understood were straight lines and maybe a circle or two. We learned how to measure them way back in elementary school. Now we’re going to extend our knowledge to the length of wiggly curves. We do this by approximating the curve by little straight segments and adding up their lengths. This approximation becomes better if we take the segments shorter and use more of them. It becomes exact if we take a limit. Hey, when we take a limit of sums of things which break an interval into more and shorter segments—that’s an integral. So suppose we have a curve r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) and we want to measure its arc length S from the point corresponding to t = a to the point corresponding to t = b. A little bit of the curve from r(t) to r(t + Δt) has length which we call Δs. For very small Δt, we can assume that we aren’t twisting around much over this time interval and we are moving in essentially a straight line. But when we move in a straight line, the distance traveled is the speed times the time interval. So, as in Figure 6.4, Adding up all of these little lengths gives us an approximation to the arc length of the curve: Taking the limit as the number of little time intervals grows and their lengths shrink, we obtain the formula for the arc length of the curve: The values of a and b determine where we begin and end on the curve. We start measuring length at r(a) and stop at r(b). Figure 6.4 Δs is approximately equal to |r’(t)| Δt. Example 3 Our bumblebee drinks up some fermented nectar at coordinates (0, 1,",

Great large circles going all the way around the world have very small curvature. Microscopic circles too tiny to see with the naked eye have super big curvature. Given a random curve in space, the curvature can vary as we move along the curve. We’re going to see how to measure exactly how much curvature there is at a point on a parameterized curve like r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t). Curvature is measured by seeing how much the tangent vector changes. Now the tangent vector of r(t) can change in two ways. It can point in different directions as we move along the curve, which is what happens as we move around a circle. It can also change by getting shorter or longer. This is not the kind of change we care about here, since it doesn’t reflect the shape of the curve, but rather how fast we are moving along the curve. So to measure curvature, we choose a parametrization r(s) in which |r’(s)| =",

This is not measuring curvature of the road; rather it’s measuring that you don’t have the faintest idea how to drive—perhaps you got your license from a correspondence school. On the other hand, you might have the car on cruise control, with the speedometer locked at 55 mph, and we’re driving on a curvy mountain road.

Solution From the above example, we know that the curve given by r(s) = R cos (s/R), R sin (s/R), 0 is a unit speed curve and gives a parametrization of the radius R circle by arc length. Then and A circle of radius R has curvature 1/R, which matches what we said about big circles having small curvature and small circles having big curvature. But what if we don’t have a parametrization by arc length? These parametrizations can be awfully difficult to find for our favorite curve. Fortunately, there’s a simple formula we can use to compute curvature which adjusts for curves given by parametrizations that are not unit speed. Since the vector-valued function r’(t)/|r’(t)| is a unit vector that is tangent to the curve at all points, it is often called the unit tangent vector and it is denoted T. Then we have the formula for computing the curvature of any parametrized curve: The curvature of an arbitrary curve r(t) is given by Example 3 Find the curvature of y = x2 at the point (x, y) = (1, 1). Solution Don’t worry yet about unit speed parametrizations. What about any parametrization at all?

People try to use it to impress other people. As in, “I have accelerated my consumption of carbohydrates,” which is a fancy way of saying, “I feel like a pig.” Mathematicians and physicists like the word, too. So they use it to help describe the motion of a particle. As we’ve seen, the tangent vector r’(t) of a moving particle r(t) gives its velocity, and the magnitude |r’(t)| gives its speed. The acceleration of the particle is the derivative of its velocity vector, and it too is a vector: a(t) = v’(t) = r“(t) The acceleration is the second derivative of the position vector r(t).

If the car’s acceleration ever has a magnitude of more than 750 mph2, then there will be a pool of recycled beer in the car.

Even if the cheese were replaced by a bag of raisins or a partially melted pint of Cherry Garcia ice cream, we would still call this a projectile problem.

This is where they show you an inkblot and ask you what it resembles. If you say, “That is a lovely butterfly flitting from flower to flower on a sunny spring day,” then you’re fine. If you say, “That is my father dancing the tango with our neighbor’s poodle,” they strap you to a gurney and pump you full of thorazine. In this section, we will derive our own Rorschach test. But our test will be based on surfaces in 3-space. This has the definite advantage that a surface is unlikely to look like your father dancing with the neighbor’s poodle. On the other hand, it does mean we will need to become proficient at graphing and recognizing various surfaces in 3-space. Now what exactly do we mean by graphing a surface in 3-space? Let’s look at what is probably the simplest example. Example 1 Graph all the points (x, y, z) in 3-space that satisfy x2 + y2 + z2 – 1 = 0 Solution Moving the 1 to the other side of the equation and taking square roots, we have . This is exactly the set of points that have distance 1 from the origin, so we get the sphere shown in Figure 7.",

Step 1 Where does the plane intersect the x-axis? Well, the x-axis is all the points where y = 0 and z = 0, so if we set y = 0 and z = 0 in the equation we will see where the plane intersects the x-axis. We get 2x = 12, so x =",

It contains everything you are likely to need to know about the rest of calculus, including, among other things, multivariable calculus and sequences and series. Why did we write it? Because of the mountain of letters of support for the first book in the series, How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide, as illustrated by the following unsolicited letter: Dear Math Types, Who would have thought that three pencil-necked number heads could come up with a book that I would enjoy reading? But there you have it. Your How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide was a great read. In fact, I find that I like mathematics so much now that in order to give myself more time for it, I am going to give up being chair of the Hazing Committee at my fraternity. I am even considering giving up beer. Of course, then I would have to resign from the frat. But hey, I don’t think I would really care anymore. Having had my eyes opened to the sublime beauty of mathematics, I have a newfound respect for the creative endeavors of humanity. This brings with it a respect for each and every individual in our diverse society. I no longer find myself judging people based on their outward appearance, such as the fact that their necks resemble pencils. I realize that physical characteristics do not reflect the immense creative potential that resides in every human being. So I thank you for changing my life. I will now dedicate myself to eradicating just the kind of attitude that I myself exemplified. I can only hope that in my small way, I can make a contribution to society that even approaches the tremendous contribution you three have made through your book. You are truly exceptional people, and I will be forever in your debt. Please feel free to call on me at any time if I can help you in any way, personally, financially, or otherwise. With the warmest of regards, Billy Bob Wainger P.S.: I can only hope and pray that you will consider writing a sequel to that first book that covers the rest of calculus, including sequences and series and multivariable calculus. Okay, okay, so it isn’t a real letter. We made it up. But what is important is the sentiment it expresses, a sentiment that was expressed in bag after bag of mail that we received regarding our first book. And we are thrilled that so many people expressed such strong feelings about our necks. If you are looking at this book in the bookstore, then either:",

For instance, what is Not so obvious, is it? If we plug in x = 2, we get . Is equal to 0, 1, ∞? Good question. In fact, the limit could be any of these. That’s why we call a limit like this an indeterminate form. The most notorious indeterminate form is If we plug in x = 0, we get . But we really need to know this limit. It comes up in a variety of situations, in particular when trying to show that the derivative of sin x is cos x using the limit definition of the derivative. There is a rule that can be used to find such limits. This rule was discovered by Johann Bernoulli, one of the great mathematicians of the seventeenth century, but it is named for the Marquis of L’Hôpital, who was paying Bernoulli to teach him calculus and taking credit for Bernoulli’s results. In fact, we authors are doing that with this book. We haven’t written a word of this, although our names are on the cover. We’re paying Bill Gates to write the whole thing. L’Hôpital is pronounced Low-pee-tall. Anyway, here’s L’Hôpital’s rule if is an indeterminate form, then What is this rule trying to tell us? It says, “If you don’t know what happens to when you take the limit, just look at instead!” Example 1 Find . Solution First we check it’s an indeterminate form by plugging x = 0 into the expression and getting . So L’Hôpital’s rule applies: Wow, was that easy! You have to love this rule. Let’s try another! Example 2 Find . Solution This is an indeterminate form . So we can apply L’Hôpital to obtain: In fact, we could actually do this without L’Hôpital. We could just do a little algebra to clean it up, like this: Hey, whatever steams your clams. Example 3 Find . Solution Again an indeterminate form ! They’re everywhere. L’Hôpital says Notice we applied L’Hôpital’s rule twice there. But we had to check that we still had an indeterminate form before we applied it the second time. Common Mistake Applying L’Hôpital’s rule to a form which is not indeterminate is a common mistake. This error can occur in any situation, but it’s especially common when L’Hôpital’s rule is being applied multiple times in a problem. Be sure to check at each stage that it still applies. INDETERMINATE FORMS INVOLVING ∞ L’Hôpital’s rule can also be applied if we have the indeterminate form . Example 4 Find . Solution If we evaluate the numerator and denominator at x = ∞, we get . So this is an indeterminate form. Let’s apply L’Hôpital: The limit is",

This is also an indeterminate form, since this product could be anything. But it’s easy enough to turn this into or by writing: Then it’s straightforward to solve. Example 5 Find . Solution Letting x go to ∞, we see that this is of the form 0 · ∞. So we rewrite it as This is now the indeterminate form , so Hey, whatever burps your baby. 2.2 Improper integrals Well, we tried to avoid it, but now we have to introduce them. You know the type. They wear a T-shirt with a tux printed on it to the Calculus Cotillion. They eat the entire dinner with the dessert fork. They laugh loudly at involuntary auditory signs of digestive distress. That’s right, we’re talking about the improper integrals. If they weren’t so important, they wouldn’t get invited at all. There are a couple of variations on this theme. First, there is the integral with unbounded interval of integration. That’s right. Instead of integrating with limits from –2 to 4 or 3 to 7, these integrals have limits from 1 to ∞ or –∞ to 2, or even –∞ to ∞. For example, we could have the integral . A second type of improper integral is one where the function being integrated goes to somewhere over the interval of integration. Take a look at , which has this problem at x =",

It seems a little strange having a limit of integration that is infinite. What are we to make of it? Well, we know by now that definite integrals often represent areas under graphs of functions. So let’s go with that viewpoint and see what it says in this case. It still makes sense to talk about the area under the curve 1/x2 for x going from 1 to ∞ (see Figure 2.1). Now we know what you’re thinking. That area goes on forever as we head out along the x-axis, so this integral must give ∞ for the answer. Easy! But hold on to your brain pan, because in fact, that’s not what happens! To see what really happens, we need to figure out the correct interpretation of that upper limit of integration ∞. The right way to think of ∞ here is as a limit of numbers which are getting very large, or . So the official interpretation of our improper integral is Figure 2.1 The area corresponding to .

But if a farmer were to grow arrows, using some genetically modified wheat, then there would be an arrow at every point in the farmer’s land, and this is called a vector field. In fact, these growing arrows are very heavy, so they don’t stand up straight—they lie on the ground. A vector field on the plane gives a two-dimensional vector at each point in the plane. An example of a simple two-dimensional vector field that we experience every day is the wind. Suppose we’re walking around our farm on a windy day. At each point on the ground the wind is blowing with a certain speed and horizontal direction. Since direction and speed are captured by a vector, we can understand which way the wind blows by giving a two-dimensional vector at each point on the ground. We can picture such a vector field by drawing the vectors at each of the points in the plane, as in Figure 10.",

    "content": "Figure 10.1 Examples of vector fields in the plane. In equations we write W(x, y) = P(x, y)i + Q(, y)j This vector field assigns to each point in the xy-plane a two-dimensional vector. Notice we are using the i, j notation for vectors. That’s because this is the notation favored by physicists, and physics is where vector fields rule. If you’re at the point where x = 3 and y = 1 (somewhere in Oklahoma) and the wind vector field is given by the formula W(x, y) = (x2 – 5y)i + (6y – x)j then the wind that you feel on your feet is described by the vector 4i + 3j. The magnitude of this vector, calculated as √42 + 32 = 5, gives the speed of the wind. The direction of the wind is given by the direction of the vector 4i + 3j. If the wind knocked you down, that’s the direction your body would point when it landed. We can also have a vector field in space. This gives a three-dimensional vector F(x, y, x) at every point (x, y, z) in 3-space. If you are flying around in an airplane, then the wind vector field is described by a function with one coordinate to measure each of the x-, y-, and z-directions. It looks like F(x, y, z) = P(x, y, z)i + Q(x, y, z)j + R(x, y, z)k Besides wind, vector fields are used to describe forces, like electric force, gravitational force, and magnetic force. Forces, like bullies, push you around if you let them. At each point in space, the strength and direction in which the force is pushing is given by a vector, so force is a vector field. Example (Gravitational Vector Field) If the Earth is centered at the origin (0, 0, 0), its gravitational force sucks everything around it down toward its center. This is what stops Australians from falling off the bottom and interfering with communication satellites. The gravitational force field is given by where c is a constant depending on which units we use. This looks messy, but as anyone who drops a tomato or an egg can testify, gravity is like that. It’s not too bad when you consider it tells how objects are affected by the Earth’s gravity no matter where they are. If a unit of mass is located at the point (0, 10,000, 0), then the gravitational vector field exerts a force on it given by the vector This illustrates the inverse square property of gravity—the force drops off like the distance squared. GRADIENT FIELDS One way to create a vector field is to take the gradient of a function. At each point, the gradient vector of the function gives a vector which is part of the resulting vector field. Taking the gradient of the function f(x, y) = xy – x2 gives the vector field Vector fields obtained in this way are called conservative, and not because they wear gray suits or blouses buttoned up to a lace collar. As we’ll see soon, moving all the way around a closed curve against a conservative force field conserves energy, and the net result is no work. Everyone is intrigued by the idea of no work, so you can see why conservative vector fields are popular. The function whose gradient we take to get a conservative vector field is called a potential function. So when your basketball coach says, “You have a lot of potential,” it may just mean that you’re a good candidate for having your gradient taken. Potential functions are a big deal in physics, where they spend a lot of time with electric potentials and such things. Gravity is also a conservative field. It’s the gradient of a function whose negative is called the gravitational potential, which for our example is The gradient of this is the gravitational force field we saw above. Hey, whatever churns your butter. 10.2 Getting acquainted with div and curl Picture yourself standing on top of a tall building on a windy day. Why would you be doing this? Well, maybe you’ve just been dumped by the love of your life, all the money that you invested in the stock of buggyparts.com just went down the tubes, and the dentist left a message that all the caps she put in your mouth last week turn out to contain a slow-acting toxic substance. So you’ve come to the roof to get a different perspective on life. And now that you’re here, you’re overcome with the wonder of wind. Boy it’s windy up here. As you move to the side a little, the wind hits you from a different angle, and with varying strength. What’s happening? Suddenly you find a reason to go on in life—trying to understand the way the wind velocity vector field W changes as you move around. THE DIVOMETER The divergence of the wind velocity, div W, measures how fast air is accumulating toward or moving away from us. If we let out a big sneeze, then the air is moving away from us, and the divergence of W (where our mouth is) is positive. If we suck in a great gasp of air, then the air is moving toward us, and the divergence is negative. To measure divergence, we can use a biological testing organism we call a divometer. The divometer consists of a single tiny amoeba, which initially is happily chugging along doing what amoebas do. To measure divergence of a vector field at a given point, we place the amoeba at the selected point and observe it carefully through a microscope. The vectors in the vector field represent the way stuff is being pushed around at different points. If the amoeba is being expanded and stretched, then the divergence is positive. If we see little bits of amoeba arms and amoeba legs flying away in all directions, that’s a sign of positive divergence. On the other tentacle, if the amoeba is being compressed, then the divergence is negative. If we see a shrinking amoeba, with little amoeba eyes bulging out, then we know the divergence is negative. If the amoeba is getting carried along, but without being stretched or squished, we know the divergence is",

Please don’t send letters.] Let’s take a look at the official formula for divergence of a vector field F. That’s right, it’s just the sum of the partial derivative with respect to x of the x-component of the vector field plus the partial derivative with respect to y of the y-component of the vector field plus the partial derivative with respect to z of the z-component of the vector field. It’s called the divergence since if the vector field represented the velocity vectors of a flowing fluid, say hot fudge for instance, the divergence gives the net rate at which the hot fudge is diverging away from or toward a given point. Notice that at any point in space, div F is a number, so div F is an ordinary old function on 3-space. Example 1 What’s div F if F = 3x3zi + 4xyzj + yz2k?

    "content": "In Figure 10.2c, the amoeba would get squeezed in on itself, so the divergence is negative. There is a trick we can use to remember the formula for the divergence. We form a slightly warped vectorlike object called “del.” Even though its components are not numbers, we treat it like a vector anyway, showing it the respect it may not deserve. We call an operator because it makes no sense by itself. Like a surgeon, it has to have something to operate on. A surgeon with no one to operate on isn’t really a surgeon at all. No patients means no income, no Porsche, no status, no proud mother, no house on the beach. Using , the formula for the divergence becomes Formula for the Divergence of F div F = · F If we write out this dot product, we see that MEASURING CURL WITH THE CURLOMETER The curl of the wind vector field W, curl W, measures its spinning effect. It tells you how fast the wind is trying to spin you around, and about what axis. Curl W is a vector field that lines up with the axis along which the wind is trying to twirl you, and whose magnitude indicates the strength of the twirling effect. We can measure curl by using a variation on the pinwheel (not the pinwheel that kids play with). We call our measuring device a curlometer. On a curlometer the blades catching the wind are completely flat, like the blades of a paddle wheel or a mill wheel. There’s a (rather painful) way to make one, which we don’t recommend, but it’ll give you the idea and you won’t forget it for a long time. Put the curlometer paddles on a sharp pin and stick the pin into the tip of your finger (Hey, now that’s what they should have called a “pinwheel”). (See Figure 10.3.) Figure 10.2 What’s the divergence at these points? Figure 10.3 The curlometer—a device that measures curl. [Editor’s Note: Please, please, use tape to attach the pin to your finger. Otherwise, you might get an infection and sue us.] A curlometer doesn’t spin as readily as a pinwheel. If you blow along its axis, the thing won’t turn at all. All your hot air will just glide right past those blades. And if you put the curlometer out into a steady constant wind, it still won’t turn, because the wind that pushes the blades clockwise is exactly balanced by the wind that pushes the blades counterclockwise. It’s completely useless! But don’t give up yet. It does twirl in certain winds. When the wind vector field varies from point to point, and the wind on one side is stronger than the wind on the other side, then it twirls like a baton at the Marching Band Olympics. Try it—if you just blow on the blades on one side of it, it turns beautifully. It’s measuring curl, the tendency of a vector field to twirl things around an axis. There are some positions you can hold it in where it won’t spin at all, and some where it rotates like crazy. Here’s how to use it to measure the curl at a given point: Hold it so that the center of the curlometer, your fingertip, stays at the point you’re interested in. Now rotate your hand around till you find the direction for the axis that makes the curlometer whirl as fast as possible. Find the absolute best you can do, twirling-wise, with the center of the curlometer immovable. (If your whole body has become immovable, you might want to stop to see when you got your last tetanus shot.) The curl of the wind vector field W is a new vector field curl W. The vector field curl W tells us all about what that curlometer is doing. The magnitude of curl W tells us how fast the curlometer is turning. The direction of curl W is the direction in which your finger is pointing. We left out one tiny detail: You want to find the direction the curlometer is rotating the fastest COUNTERCLOCKWISE, when you look toward your fingertip. Otherwise if you and your brother try this together, one of you will end up upside down shouting “I have it!” while the other will be right side up shouting “No, I have it!” and general confusion will ensue. So agree in advance, counterclockwise. This counterclockwise direction is easy to remember by using the “right-thumb rule.” When you take the thumb of your right hand to be pointing in the same direction as the vector curl W, your fingers will be curling in the direction that the vector field is twirling. Here’s how to remember this. Take the pin out of your finger and insert it in the thumb of your right hand. Now point your thumb so the curlometer is twirling as rapidly as possible in the direction your fingers are pointing. Your thumb is pointing in the same direction as curl W. Okay, we’re done, you can take the pin out now. So say we have a vector field F(x, y, x) = P(x, y, z)i + Q(x, y, z)j + R(x, y, z)k. What’s the formula for the curl of F at a point (x0, y0, z0)? The curl is a vector with three components, and its formula is a bit complicated. Luckily, there’s a shortcut for remembering this. Treating as the vector we can get curl F by taking the cross product of and F: Example 3 Find the curl of the vector field F(x, y, z) = 3x2zi + 4xyzj + yz2k. Solution Hey, whatever twirls your baton. 10.3 Line up for line integrals While ordinary integrals are evaluated over an interval [a, b], line integrals are evaluated over a curve in space. Line integrals are also called path integrals, and paths are also called curves. Paths that start and end at the same point are called loops or closed curves. There are several different kinds of line integrals. The first kind involves integrating a function over a curve. You will remember in",

    "content": "that we figured out how to find the arc length of a curve C, described by the parametrization r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t), as t varies from t = a to t = b. The idea was to cut the curve up into lots of little pieces, so small that they were almost straight-line segments. The length of each piece was approximately the speed |r’(t)| times the time interval Δt. Adding all these up, and taking a limit as the size of the time intervals shrunk to 0, gave us the arc length as an integral: But now we may want to find some quantity other than the arc length. For example, we can integrate the density function of a curvy piece of wire to get the total mass of the wire. The mass of a little segment of wire is about equal to the product of the length of that segment and the density σ(x, y, z) at a spot on the segment, or σ ds. The total mass of the wire is given by Example (Total Mass) The artist Tofu Dancer is designing a necklace in the shape of a wire, strung around a circle with radius 1 foot. Its density at a point (x, y) is given by σ(x, y) = 3 + 2y pounds per foot. What is the total mass of the necklace?

That’s why moving companies charge extra to move a piano into a fifth-floor walk-up. The work done by a force, like gravity, in moving a particle in a straight line, is the dot product F · D of the force vector F with the displacement vector D. The displacement vector is the vector that points from where the particle began to where the particle ends up. This means that if you lug a piano up four flights, then the work done by gravity is negative, while the amount done by your muscles is positive. If you drop the piano out the fifth-floor window, then the work done by gravity as it falls is positive. The net amount of work done by gravity on the round trip is zero. Suppose instead that we are not moving a particle along a straight line. Let’s face it. How often in life do you move a particle in a straight line? Usually you are zigzagging all over the place, through the hallway, around the corner, up the stairs. So let’s suppose that we are moving the particle along a curve. And what about that force vector? What if the force varies depending on where we are? Then we need to represent the force by a vector field, the vectors of which change depending upon where we are on the curve we’re moving the particle along. To compute the work, we think of splitting up the curve into lots of tiny little pieces. As we move along one of the very little pieces, it is almost a straight line. And the force vectors change so little over that little piece that we can assume there is a fixed force vector for that little piece. So we can compute the work in moving the particle along that little piece as the dot product of a fixed force vector and the short displacement vector that approximates our motion. Summing up the approximate work as we move the particle along all the tiny bits of the curve gives us an approximation to the total work of moving the particle along the entire curve. By taking our pieces smaller and smaller, we get a limit which turns the sum into an integral. To calculate these integrals, we parametrize the curve C by a vector valued function r(t), write everything as a function of t, take dot products, and eventually have an ordinary old integral in t from a to b to evaluate: Example 1 (Cold Soda in a Hot Tub) Internet retailer SodaEverywhere.com is designing its new soda-dispensing hot tub. The force of the circulating water is described by the vector field F(x, y) = x2i – 2xyj. The bench with the best view of the built-in TV is located at (0, 1). The cooler containing the ice cold cola is located at (1, 0). (See Figure 10.4.) Market research shows that the targeted customer will move in a straight line from the bench to the cooler several dozen times in an afternoon. How much work will the customer need to do each time he moves from the bench to the soda? Solution We need to work out the line integral for work, ∫C F · dr. We first come up with a parametrized curve r(t) which traces out C. This curve, or path, is a straight line, so the curve is given by r(t) = (1 – t)A + (t)B, where A and B are the initial and final position vectors. So with 0 ≤ t ≤",

This happens when the vector field is the gradient of a function, a common situation when studying electric and gravitational forces. The gradient of a function f on a region R is a conservative vector field. The situation here is similar to a situation we have seen before, namely, the fundamental theorem of calculus. It told us that when g(x) = G’(x) then ∫ba g(x) dx = G(b) – G(a), and that made calculating integrals a lot easier. Similarly, when C is a curve in a region R going from a point given by A to a point given by B, and F = f in R there’s an easy way to calculate ∫C F · dr. We can think of this as a vector version of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Let’s see how easy it can be to calculate with these conservative fields: Example 1 Check that F = (2x + 3y)i + (3x–2y)j is conservative, and compute the line integral ∫C F · dr along the path which follows the quarter of a unit radius circle going counterclockwise from (1,",

But how did we find this function? Well, since f = F, we must have that Integrating with respect to the variable x gives f(x, y) = x2 + 3xy + g(y), where g(y) is any function depending on y but not on x, and therefore having 0 as its partial derivative with respect at x. Differentiating this with respect to y gives Setting this equal to the second component (3x – 2y) of F, we see that g’(y) = –2y and so g(y) = –y2 + K We can take the constant K to be zero since we’re calculating a definite integral (any choice gives the same result). So we see that f(x, y) = x2 + 3xy – y2 is a function such that f = F. Note that f(x, y) = x2 + 3xy – y2 + K is another function with f = F, for any constant K. This means F is conservative, so it’s easy to find the line integral. We don’t need to parametrize a curve or take any dot products. We just calculate ∫C F · dr = ∫C f · dr = f(0,",

By contrast, nonconservative vector fields can go around in a circle and run up a deficit.) So how do we tell if a vector field is conservative? First let’s see how to tell that it’s NOT conservative. If a vector field F = Pi + Qj is conservative, then F = f for some function f(x, y), so P = ∂f/∂x and Q = ∂f/∂y. If we take the partial of P with respect to y, we find Consequently, A conservative vector field always satisfies If these partial derivatives are not equal or don’t exist somewhere in a region, then the vector field is not conservative in the region.

Solution ∂P/∂y = x2 and ∂Q/∂x = 3x2 so ∂P/∂y ≠ ∂Q/∂x. Therefore this vector field is NOT conservative. (It’s also not liberal, more of a middle-of-the-road type.) What if ∂P/∂y = ∂Q/∂x? Can we then conclude the vector field is conservative? Can we find an f(x, y) with f = F? Not always. We need another condition to be sure that we can find a potential function f(x, y) with f = F. This extra condition is that F is defined on a domain with no holes in it, a region which is called simply connected. Regions R and S, but not the unhappy region T, are simply connected in Figure 10.",

Common Mistake ∂P/∂y = ∂Q/∂x must be true everywhere in a simply connected region for F = Pi + Qj to be conservative. It’s not enough for it to be true along a path or loop. It must hold everywhere inside the loop before we can assert that there is an f with f = F and that the line integral of F over the loop is zero. Example 3 Take F to be the vector field Compute ∮C F · dr along the path C which goes counterclockwise once around the unit circle, starting and ending at (1, 0). Note We have written the integral symbol ∮ with a little circle through it. This indicates that we are doing a line integral around a loop, a path that starts and ends at the same point. Solution Let’s check to see if F is conservative. If it is, the problem is easy, because the path we are integrating over is a loop, starting and ending at the same point, and the line integral of a conservative vector field over a loop equals zero. So let’s calculate. By the quotient rule and So these two are equal and it is tempting to say that F is conservative. But that would be WRONG. The problem is that F, ∂P/∂y and ∂Q/∂x are not defined at the point (0, 0), where there is a division by zero. The region where they are equal excludes (0, 0), and is NOT simply connected. And in fact F is NOT conservative on a region containing the whole loop. There is no function f(x, y) whose gradient equals F and whose domain contains the whole curve C. Let’s calculate what the line integral actually is. We’ll have to parametrize the curve and calculate. So take r(t) = cos ti + sin tj 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π to be a parametrization of the unit circle.

Whew, good thing we were careful! 10.6 Green’s theorem If the difference ∂Q/∂x – ∂P/∂y is not zero, then F is not conservative, and the line integral does depend on the path taken. It may turn out not to be zero along a loop. Green’s theorem tells us how to calculate the line integral of any vector field around a loop. We have to go around the loop counterclockwise to make this result work. The region D must be on our left as we walk around it along its boundary curve C. (See Figure 10.6). Counterclockwise is referred to as “positively oriented.” Theorem (Green’s Theorem in the Plane) If C is a positively oriented loop which encloses a region D and F = Pi + Qj is a vector field on D, then In the case of a conservative vector field, both sides of the equation are zero. This is a pretty amazing result when you think about it. A double integral over an entire region is equal to a line integral that takes place only on the boundary of that region. It’s sort of like judging everything in a book by looking only at the boundary—with vector fields you really can judge a book by its cover. Figure 10.6 Green’s theorem states that a line integral over the curve C equals an integral over the region D.

Whatever battens down your hatches. 10.7 Integrating the divergence; the divergence theorem Green’s theorem has a cousin which tells what happens when we integrate the divergence of a function, called appropriately enough the divergence theorem. There are two versions, one for the plane and one for space. Remember that divergence measures the net inflow or outflow of a vector field at a point. When we integrate divergence over a region, we get the net amount of stuff that is being created or destroyed in the whole region. As you might expect, this is equal to the amount flowing in or out of the region across its boundary, and that is just what the divergence theorem says. Example 1 (A Toxic Example) Toxic waste is swirling around in a shallow superfund site surrounded by a fence. Waste is being introduced at some points (leaking drums). These points are called “sources” and have positive divergence. At other points called “sinks,” the waste gets sucked away and has negative divergence. (In the old days toxic waste was flushed down the sink, hence the name.) The toxic waste sloshes around, giving rise to a velocity vector field. At each point in the site the velocity vector field measures the direction and speed at which the liquid (or sludge or PCBs) at that point is moving. A certain amount flows out of the boundary of the toxic waste site and into the neighboring homes. The question everyone wants the answer to is “How will it affect property values?” or in other words, “How much is flowing out?” The divergence theorem tells us the answer. Solution By adding up (integrating) the total divergence of the velocity vector field, we get the total flow through the fence. Example 2 (The Party Line Integral*) A huge rambunctious party is going on inside a large room. Numerous people mill about, coming and going. The motion of the party goers forms a party velocity vector field. (Sociologists analyze these fields by studying the patterns of drool and spilled beer left on the floor.) Certain people act like magnets. Other party goers are attracted to them, sometimes because of their scintillating conversation, and sometimes because of how they look in a sleeveless T-shirt. They are surrounded by admirers. Though they don’t often think of themselves that way, they are what we call “sinks.” Other party goers are repellers, sometimes because they can only talk about their most recent root canal and sometimes because of how they look in a sleeveless T-shirt. Revelers move away from them as quickly as politeness allows, and often quicker. They are known as “sources.” Most people are neither sources nor sinks, but just go with the flow. The divergence theorem tells us the relationship between the sources and sinks and the number of people entering and leaving the room. It says that if we sum up, by integrating, the divergence of the party vector field, then we get the total number of people entering or leaving the room, either by sneaking past the bouncers at the door or by falling off the balcony into the pool. CALCULATING WITH THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM Let D be a region in the plane whose boundary is a curve C. In the example above, that region was the floor of the room. Let F be a vector field defined over the region D. To calculate with the divergence theorem, we need to measure how much stuff flows across the boundary of a region. This is given by integrating the flow of the vector field F across C, or calculating the “flux” (Latin for flow—and we thought our four years of Latin were wasted.) The amount of stuff being pushed across the curve is found by calculating what gets pushed across a tiny bit of curve, adding up for each little bit, and taking the limit to get an integral. The amount of stuff crossing a little curve piece with length ds is given by taking the part of F which is perpendicular to that bit of curve, since the part of F that is parallel to the curve doesn’t push anything across it, and multiplying by the length ds. The normal part of F, the part of F which is perpendicular to C, is obtained by taking the dot product of F with a vector n of length 1 that’s normal, or perpendicular, to C. (See Figure 10.7.) Figure 10.7 The amount of flow of a vector field moving across a segment of C is the product of the length of the segment with the length of the normal part of F. A unit length normal vector is usually called n. To calculate n for a curve r(t) = x(t), y(t) in the plane, we use the formula where . This gives a vector of length 1 whose dot product with the tangent vector x’(t)i + y’(t)j is zero. The flux is then given by Flux = ∮C F · n ds The divergence theorem says that this integral that gives the flux is in fact equal to the integral of the divergence of F, denoted · F, over D, the region enclosed by C. The curve C must be parametrized so that the region D is on the left as we walk along C. The divergence theorem is very similar to Green’s theorem, but the things being integrated are a little different. With Green’s theorem the line integral integrates the tangential part of the vector field over the boundary, while with the divergence theorem it integrates the perpendicular part over the boundary. Here’s the actual theorem: Theorem (Divergence Theorem in the Plane) (Continuity is required of F and div F in D.) Example 3 Calculate the flux of the vector field F = xi + yj across the circle of radius 3 centered at (0, 0). Solution The divergence theorem makes this easy. div F = · F = ∂P/∂x ∂Q/∂y = 1 + 1 = 2 The theorem tells us the flux we want to know is given by Flux = ∫D∫ div F dx dy = ∫D∫ 2 dx dy – 2(area (D)) = 2π(3)2 = 18π So the amount of stuff that’s flowing out of D is twice the area of D, in this case 18π. If this is the vector field that models your local superfund site, either sell your house or start organizing a class action lawsuit. If this is the vector field that models your party, then it looks like quite a few people are falling off the balcony into the pool. 10.8 Surface integrals We would like to be able to calculate integrals over surfaces. Why? Perhaps we’re in the business of coating Edam cheese with those red wax covers and need to know how much wax to buy for different shapes of cheese. Or maybe we need to calculate the mass of a surface, where the density varies over the surface. If we are going to have any hope of computing integrals on a surface S sitting in space, we need to describe S with equations. We have already seen one way to describe such a surface, which works when it’s the graph of an equation z = f(x, y). But this isn’t the only way to describe a surface. There is another option. Just as we had parametrized curves r(t), we have parametrized surfaces r(u, v). This time there are TWO variables in the domain, u and v, because we’re looking at a two-dimensional object. Just as a longitude and a latitude are enough to tell us where we are on the surface of the Earth, with two coordinates we can tell where we are on a surface. The equations describing a parametric surface look like r(u, v) = x(u, v)i + y(u, v)j + z(u, v)k For each choice of u and v, r(u, v) is a point in space. So, for example, if we pick u = 2 and v = 5, then r(u, v) is the point in space whose x-coordinate is given by x(2, 5), whose y-coordinate is given by y(2, 5), and whose z-coordinate is given by z(2, 5). A special case is the situation we’ve looked at before, when a surface is given as the graph of z = f(x, y). In vector form, this becomes r(x, y) = xi + yj + f(x, y)k The z-coordinate here is a function of the x- and y-coordinates. For each choice of x and y there is only one z-value. This kind of formula is good for modeling things like roofs or circus tents, where there is at most one point of the surface overhead. PARAMETRIZED SURFACES AND THEIR AREAS The integral for the area of a parametric surface S is found, as usual, by a limiting process. To get the formula, we first need the area of a little parallelogram whose sides are given by vectors A and B. As we saw in",

Now suppose that r(u, v) describes the surface. A little parallelogram on the surface formed by the edges from r(u, v) to r(u + ▵u, v) and from r(u, v) to r(u, v + ▵v), as in Figure 10.8, has area approximately given by Area (parallelogram) = |(r(u+ ▵u, v) – r(u, v)) × (r(u, v + ▵v) – r(u, v))| This little area equals In the limit this becomes dS = |ru × rv| du dv where ru = ∂r/∂u and rv = ∂r/∂v.

A particularly simple situation is when S is given as a graph of z = f(x, y), where (x, y) lie in a region D in the xy-plane. This has a parametrization, where x = u, y = v, and z = f(x, y). So r(x, y) = x, y, f(x, y). Then, ru = rx = 1, 0, ∂f/∂x, and rv = ry = 0, 1, ∂f/∂y. So ru × rv = –∂f/∂x, –∂f/∂y,",

The area of a graph z = f(x, y) over a region D in the xy-plane: Example 1 (Area of a Cylinder) Find a parametric representation of the cylinder of radius 3 around the z-axis between z = 0 and z = 10, and calculate its area. Solution We parametrize the circle of radius 3 by C(θ) = 3 cos θ, 3 sin θ 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π A point on the cylinder is specified by using θ to give a point on the circle, and adding a z-value to tell how high the point is. So a parametric representation of the cylinder is r(θ, z) = 3 cos θ, 3 sin θ, z 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ z ≤ 10 In vector form, this can be written as r(u, v) = 3 cos ui + 3 sin uj + vk 0 ≤ u ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ v ≤ 10 To calculate the area of S, we calculate ru × rv. ru = –3 sin ui + 3 cos uj + 0k and rv = 0i + 0j + 1k Then ru × rv = 3 cos ui + 3 sin uj and So This is equal to the length of the circle, 6π, times the height 10, which is just as well, since that’s another way we get the surface area of a cylinder. INTEGRATING FUNCTIONS OVER A SURFACE IN SPACE As we mentioned previously, there are many situations in which we want to integrate a function over a surface. For instance, we might want to calculate the mass of a surface whose density, or mass per unit area, varies over the surface. This occurs with those hollow chocolate bunnies that people eat around Easter. The chocolate is not uniformly distributed over the bunny, but we would want to know the total mass of the chocolate we are eating. We can find the mass by integrating the density function over the surface of the bunny. A surface S whose density is given by a function σ(x, y, z) has total mass given by adding up the density of little bits of the surface times the areas of those little bits. So the total mass is given by Total mass = ∫S∫ σ(x, y, z) dS How we calculate this depends on how the surface S is represented. If S is a parametrized surface r(u, v) = x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v), then we see that dS = |ru × rv| du dv and the formula for integrating the function σ(x, y, z) over the surface is ∫S∫ σ(x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)) |ru × rv|du dv Example 2 (Calculus of Roofing) The architect Svenn Diagram has planned a soaring roof for the new math building. The roof is made of a cutting-edge space-age material of varying density. The roof is described by the graph of the function z = 10 + 2x + 2y over the rectangle 0 ≤ x ≤ 20, 0 ≤ y ≤ 15 (in meters). The density function of the roof at (x, y, z) is given by σ(x, y, z) = (100 – z) kilograms per square meter. If the total mass of the roof is greater than 60,000 kilograms, the building collapses on its occupants, and there is no more math at the university. If the total mass of the roof is less than 40,000 kilograms, the roof blows away on the first windy day. Determine the mass of the roof and whether Svenn will ever get another job. (For this problem, assume that people will be upset if the roof collapses on the math department.) Solution Since this surface is the graph of f(x, y) = 10 + 2x + 2y, we calculate the mass to be So the mass is within the right bounds, and the roof will stay put. Unfortunately, Svenn didn’t bother to put any bathrooms in the building, so the beautiful new structure is surrounded by Port-a-Pottys. Looks like Svenn might have trouble finding his next commission. FLUX OF A VECTOR FIELD ACROSS A SURFACE IN SPACE We can compute the flux of a vector field F across a surface S just like we did for a curve in the plane. The surface integral, or flux of F across S, is given by Flux = ∫S∫ F · n dS where n is a unit length normal vector field to S. The flux is measuring the flow of F across the surface S. Let’s take a closer look at n dS when we have a parametrization of S over a region D in the plane. Since ru × rv is a normal vector for the surface, it’s equal to a unit normal vector n times its length |ru × rv|, ru × rv = |ru × rv|n So Since dS = |ru × rv|du dv, we have that n dSru = (ru × rv) du dv So we know that The vector (ru × rv) is straightforward to calculate. Example 3 (Bee Flux) A beehive lies inside a chickenwire cage described by the equation x2 + y2 + z2 =",

We calculate Also F(r(φ, θ)) = (sin φ cos θ)i + (sin φ sin θ)j + (cos φ)k The dot product is: So we have That’s about 12 bees per second. Should get you moving up the trail. THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM IN 3-SPACE The divergence theorem for 3-space says that the total divergence of a vector field in a solid region V in space equals the total flow across the boundary surface S of the region. Theorem (Divergence Theorem in Space) (F and div F need to be continuous in the region V.) Example 4 We’ll recalculate the bee flux in Example 3 the easy way, using the divergence theorem. The theorem tells us that so we can calculate the flux by integrating the divergence over the inside of the beehive cage. The divergence of the vector field F(x, y, z) = xi + yj + zk is given by So Since the volume of a ball of radius 1 is (4/3)π, this equals (3)(4/3)π = 4π. Just what we got before. Which way would you want to do the calculation if a swarm of bees was streaming toward you? 10.9 Stoking! Stokes’s theorem describes an amazing connection between line integrals and surface integrals of vector fields. It looks at a surface (called S) hanging around in space, which is not closed, but rather has an edge, or boundary, which is a curve (called C), as in Figure 10.",

Adding up all the swirling of F along the surface S measures the amount by which the vector field is trying to twist the boundary curve of S. The total curl of F on the surface S is equal to the line integral of F, which measures how much of the vector field is lined up along C. (Continuity is required of F and curl F). This theorem is really useful when one of these quantities is easier to calculate than the other. Stokes’s theorem allows us to pick the easier path to the answer. Stokes’s theorem requires the right choice of direction. If the vector field n, which is perpendicular to the surface, points in the same direction as your head and you are walking along C, then the surface S has to be on your left. Mess this up and you get the answer with a minus sign in front of it. There is a special case of Stokes’s theorem when the surface S is a region in the plane. We’ll talk first about this easy case. The unit normal vector n is then just k, and the theorem becomes: Theorem (Stokes’s Theorem in the Plane) Suppose D is a region in the plane with boundary curve C, oriented counterclockwise. Then ∮C F · dr = (curl F) · k dA Example 1 (Escape from New York Ballet) A group of twirling ballet dancers has escaped opening night at the New York Ballet and is twirling through midtown Manhattan. The police, thinking quickly, throw a rope around the rotating dancers, holding them until their choreographers can come to claim them. As the spinning dancers come up against the rope, they exert a twisting force which pulls the rope around the group. The police know that they can maintain their control as long as the force along the rope is no more than 1000 (Newtons, if you care about units; Fig Newtons if you care about cookies). The force generated by the dancers is given by F(x, y) = (–2y)i + (2x)j (same units), and the rope is described by the circle C given by x2 + y2 =",

You may notice that it looks suspiciously like Green’s theorem. Stokes’s theorem in the plane is pretty much the same as Green’s theorem. But Stokes’s theorem also works when S is a surface in space.

In general, they just tell you to compute the integral of some function over a region in the plane or in space. Often the hardest part of the problem is to describe the region correctly, using the right coordinate system. You will need to do two or three integrals to carry out a multiple integral calculation, and you will need to choose the right order for the variables that you integrate with respect to, depending on how you describe the region. Trick Always check that your answer is reasonable. You can make very rough estimates to see if you are in the ballpark. If you are calculating the volume inside a ball of radius 1, then your answer should certainly be less than the volume of a cube enclosing that ball. Such a cube is 2 × 2 × 2 and has volume 8, so if your answer is 214 you know you’ve got to redo the problem. If your volume calculation gives you a negative answer, that’s also an indication to recheck your work. If your volume calculation gives you an answer like “3x2 — 7πy,” which has variables in it, then either you have not set up your integral correctly or you didn’t integrate from the inside working out.",

    "content": "Polar Coordinates 3.1 Introduction to polar coordinates You know how in all those Cold War movies where we’re submerged in a submarine and there’s a Soviet sub just 50 feet away, so everybody has to be really quiet or else well get a torpedo right up the torpedo tube? And there’s this one ensign sitting in front of the the radarscope, and on the scope there is this green radial ray that goes round and round. And all of the sailors are sweating like they just took showers in their clothes, because after all, they are packed into a sardine can and there’s not enough room to bring inessentials like deodorant. And the captain whispers, “Not a sound. Nobody make a sound.” And all the while, that line on the radarscope is going round and round. And each time it goes round, a big green dot corresponding to the enemy sub shows up on the screen. And every time that line goes round the scope beeps. Yes, that’s right. It beeps like an alarm clock going off in the middle of the night. And you just have to wonder, sitting there in front of the TV, why can’t the Russians hear the stupid scope? Do they have cotton stuffed in their ears? Are they confusing the beep of that scope with their own? The fact of the matter is that scope is loud enough to wake the dead. And as you sit in your home theater, you want to say to the captain, “You don’t have to whisper. Nobody could hear you over the damn scope.” You could sing God Bless America with your tonsils popping out the back of your throat, and the Russians would say, “Comrade, did you hear something?” “Comrade, I can’t hear anything over that damn radarscope.” And of course, in at least 80 percent of these movies, the action is taking place under the polar ice cap. This is where submarines tend to bump into one another. So it’s no big surprise that the coordinates used for the scope are called polar coordinates. The ensign whispers to the captain in a very loud whisper, in order to be heard over the scope, “Captain, looks like a C class nuclear ranger. Appears to be carrying 37 men, 12 women, and one free-range chicken. She’s 50 feet away and closing.” The scope always puts your own position at the center. Your first measurement of the other point is its distance from you, in this case 50 feet. Then Radar Boy adds, “She’s at 37 degrees,” meaning that she is 50 feet out, at an angle of 37 degrees from the positive x-axis. We would say that the polar coordinates of the point are (r, θ) = (50, 37°). Of course, unlike the navy, we use radians, because all mathematicians have agreed always to use radians. It makes our computations easier. If all you use angles for is to aim an occasional torpedo, then degrees are fine. But if you want to do hard-core mathematics with the big dogs, then radians are the way to go. To describe a point in the plane in polar coordinates, we give its distance from the origin, called r, and its angle in radians going counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, which we call θ. So, instead of using (x, y), we describe a point by (r, θ), as in Figure 3.",

Not one of those stylized hearts from Valentine’s Day that has only the slightest resemblance to the thing beating in your chest, but an actual version of the organ itself. You can tell it’s a real heart because it has a Latin name. Figure 3.7 Graph of the cardioid r = 1 + sin θ. Cardioids will be the result of any of the equations r = a(1 ± sin θ) or r = a(1 ± cos θ). When people say, “She has a heart as big as the great outdoors,” they mean a is large. The choice of sin or cos determines if the heart is sideways or upright. Whether it’s + or – determines whether the heart faces right side up, or upside down (or right side right or left). These last few examples are the Who’s Who of polar equations. They come up again and again, so it’s probably worth learning them cold. 3.2 Area in polar coordinates Just as curves in rectangular coordinates bound areas, so do curves in polar coordinates. Since we know how to find the area between curves given in rectangular coordinates, we could take curves described in polar coordinates, convert them to rectangular coordinates, and then find the areas. But this is akin to translating a poem by Robert Frost into Russian to decide how much we like it. Instead, we will see how to compute areas directly in polar coordinates. Suppose that we want to find the area bounded by two radial lines given by θ = α and θ = β, and by the curve r = f(θ), for α ≤ θ ≤ β. (See Figure 3.8.) This looks like a job for Riemann Sums, or put another way, time to “divide and conquer.” We approximate the region by thin pie segments. Speaking of pie, lemon meringue is a favorite dessert at math dinners. And when pie gets served, the first thing everybody does is discuss how to find the area of a piece of pie. (Actually, the first thing everyone does is check to see who got the biggest piece.) If the piece of pie has radius r and angle φ, as in Figure 3.9, then the whole pie has area πr2 and the fraction of that area in our particular piece is the fraction of the total angle 2π given by φ. That is to say, the area of the wedge is . Figure 3.8 Area bounded by θ = α, θ = β, and r = f(θ). Figure 3.9 Finding the area of a piece of pie. In case you were wondering what math dinners are like, now you know. You should see what happens when it comes to splitting the bill. Let’s return to the problem at hand, finding the area of the region. Take a look at Figure 3.",

We choose the radius of the ith pie wedge to be ri = f(θ*i). The area of the ith pie wedge is given by Figure 3.10 Approximating the area by pieces of pie. So the area of the entire region is approximately equal to the sum of these, namely: If we take the limit as the wedges get thinner and thinner, then in the limit, the sum becomes an integral and we get the area: Let’s try an example. Example 1 (Seeing through the Windshield Problem) As you are driving by the Little League fields, a large brown glob of chewing tobacco lands on your windshield. You turn on your windshield wiper and it smears the brown glob over a region on your windshield bounded by θ = 0, θ = π/2, and r = 1 + cos θ, where r is measured in feet.

They are simple and straightforward. Nothing fancy to operate. We just put in a single number and wait for the output. We know them, and some of them we even love. Take f(x) = sinx, for example. What’s not to love? Even the function r(t) = 2 + t, 3 – 5t, 7t only depends on a single variable t, though it gives us a vector in 3-space as its output. But we’re moving up in the world—we’d like a penthouse apartment with a park view, a red convertible, and we’d like to keep some fancier functions of more than one variable around to make the place look classy. What’s a way to think of a function of two variables? It’s just a function machine with two mouths. We feed f two numbers, x and y, and it spits out another number, f(x, y). Why does it spit out just one number? Why not two, or even three? Well it could. But first, let’s get a handle on this crowd. The hardcore stuff comes later. Example 1 f(x, y) = 2x + y Put in the pair of numbers (2, 3). What pops out? This is not a trick question; 7 pops out. Does it matter which order the pair was put in? Absolutely. Put in the pair (3, 2). If you still get 7, have a cup of coffee and try again. You should get",

That is the concept of contour curves. When they appear on a contour map, they allow you to visualize the terrain. For our purposes, they allow us to visualize graphs of surfaces in 3-space. A WALK IN THE WOODS You’ve been lost in Tepid Water State Park in the Less-than-Grand Tetons for the last 3 days. You’ve eaten the leather from your wallet, and sucked the juice out of the last piece of bark your stomach will tolerate, when you remember you have a map in your left front shirt pocket. It’s one of those contour maps, with lots of squiggly green lines, each of which represents an altitude. You spot the highest point on the map, Mount Middling, and then peer through the forest to spot the highest point in sight from where you are. Aha, this must be Mount Middling. Before noon the next day, you are perched atop the mountain, looking down at the less-than-awe-inspiring scene. Now the question is how do you get down to the trading post at the park entrance, where they sell prewrapped hotdogs that can be nuked lukewarm in their microwave oven. Of course, you realize that the contour curves represent the intersection curves of horizontal planes with the mountain. So you can reconstruct the shape of the mountain from the map, and find your way to postmodern civilization, hold the mustard. We do the same thing without the hotdogs. By keeping track of the contour curves of a surface, we can get a good idea of what the surface looks like. Example 1 Determine contour curves for the surface given by f(x, y) = 4 – x2 – y",

But maybe first we should review limits of functions of one variable. LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF ONE VARIABLE: A RETROSPECTIVE Do you remember the idea of limits? Basically, limits are about falling in love. We say if, as x approaches a, f(x) approaches L. That is to say, f(x) becomes more and more enamored of L as x approaches a. It doesn’t matter what f(x) equals when x = a, it just matters what it’s approaching. For instance, As another example, look at Although is undefined at x = 1, it’s still true that With a function of one variable, there are exactly two ways that x can approach a, from the left (so x < a) or from the right (so x > a). Only in the case that f(x) approaches the same value L when x approaches a from the left and right does the limit exist. LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE For functions of more than one variable, limits are still about falling in love. Now when you really fall in love, it’s not instantaneous. Those sudden infatuations when you see someone across the room usually lead to nothing but trouble, because, as attractive as someone might seem at a quick glance, if he trims his toenails with a machete, and burps himself to sleep at night, your life together will not be idyllic. No, falling in love should be a slow, gradual process, where each little thing this person does endears him or her to you just a bit more. That’s the way functions fall in love. Example 1 Find the limit of f(x, y) = x2y + x as (x, y) approaches (1,1). Solution As (x, y) approaches (1,1), x2y + x approaches",

Unlike what happens for limits of functions of one variable, there are not just two paths to consider as x approaches a, one from the right and one from the left. No, now we have a point (x, y) in the xy-plane approaching another point (a, b). There are many many different paths from (x, y) to (a, b), as in Figure 8.9, which shows three of them. We could take any of them. We could take a straight line path. We could take a curving path. We could take a spiral path. If the limit is to exist, the answer has to be the same for all of them. You see, true love transcends the path you take to get there. (This book is not just about math. It’s about life.)

Hey, whatever garnishes your potato salad. 8.4 Continuity Functions come in two varieties, continuous and discontinuous. Continuous functions have nice graphs without holes and tears. Discontinuous functions are dangerous. That’s how you recognize them. They generate the kind of terrain that should only be tackled with climbing gear. Suppose you’re out for a hike. What should you watch out for? Holes, the bane of every hiker’s existence. You put a foot in a hole, and it’s bye bye leg bone, and then, you’re bear meat come sunset. Of course, it won’t do you any good avoiding holes if in the process you walk off the edge of a cliff. Then it’s a long, seemingly slow drop to certain death on the rocks below. And the worst part is, your entire life flashes before your eyes, in slo mo, including the time you had the little accident on that bus trip to the Museum of Natural History, and the time Tommie Flecker told everyone that you had a crush on Mr. Rogers. And if holes and cliffs aren’t bad enough, the worst is when you walk up a slope and inadvertently fall into the spewing crater of Mount St. Helens. That can be quite a ride, as the cinder that was once you is spit out into the Oregon sky. Yes, these are all examples of discontinuities. Figure 8.10 A graph with three types of discontinuities. You probably have fond memories of discontinuities of functions of one variable. The three situations described, holes, cliffs, and volcanos, each appear in the graph of the function y = f(x) in Figure 8.10, and at each of these points, the function is discontinuous. At the other points, the function is continuous and happy as a clam. We’ve seen an official definition of what it meant for a function of one variable to be continuous at a point, which goes like this: A function f(x) is continuous at x = a if .

Okay, so now suppose you find yourself standing on the side of Mount Everest, wearing your incredibly expensive mountaineering equipment, colored neon yellow and black, the same clothes that made you feel so cool when you tried them on at L. L. Bean. But now you’re not feeling so cool. Now you are downright cold. The wind is whistling up through the bottom of the coat since you forgot to tighten one of the high-tech drawstrings. You are tethered to a rope that’s hooked into a piton jammed into some crack in the rock above your head, and the other end of the rope is held by the Finnish expedition leader. He is gesturing to you desperately and yelling Finnish gibberish. It seems like ever since the expedition began, all he has been doing is gesturing at you desperately and screaming Finnish gibberish. The wind is picking up fast and the temperature seems to be dropping at an incredible rate. You find yourself wondering once again why, when you were floating in that pool sipping that tropical drink, you decided you needed more adventure. Figure 8.12 The derivative of f(x) gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of y = f(x). You figure the Scandanavian mountain guy is probably saying it’s time to head back down to the base camp for a delicious cup of hot cocoa with reconstituted miniature marshmallows, so you take a step in the easterly direction. Unfortunately, in that direction, the next time your foot would touch rock again is 200 feet down in the negative z-direction. Luckily, the piton holds and the Finnish tour guide is now screaming incomprehensibly at you, veins bulging in his forehead, as he grasps the belay rope from which you dangle. Of course, the problem is that the slope of the mountain in the easterly direction is quite steep. You finally manage to get a foot back on the mountain. You notice that if you step off in the northerly direction, the direction that the Finn is desperately motioning toward, you will touch mountain again only 2 feet down in the negative z-direction. The slope of the mountain in that direction is not so steep. That gets you to thinking about that multivariable calculus class you had in college. You remember that when you are at a point on a surface in 3-space, as for instance occurs when you are standing on a mountain, there is more than one slope. For any of the compass directions in which you could head, there is a slope, which is the slope of the tangent line in that direction. Suppose that the surface of the mountain is given by the graph of z = f(x, y), with the positive x-axis pointing in the easterly direction and the positive y-axis pointing in the northerly direction (see Figure 8.13). The fact that as you step east, your foot dangles in the air a long way above the mountain suggests that the tangent line in the x-direction has a large negative slope, say a slope of –",

Now f(x, y) = sin x cos y — there’s a function that will see you through Thanksgiving and well into New Year’s, too: f(x, y) = sin x cos y fx = cos x cos y fy = – sin x sin y fyx = – cos x sin y fxx = – sin x cos y fxxx = – cos x cos y fxxxx = sin x cos y This function has an endless number of partial derivatives; you can take them one after another, in any order, they never quit. We just stuck on all those x’s so that we’ll get a lot of hits when we post this on our Web site. Notice that when we take the so-called second partials, we have four possibilities, namely, fxx, fyy, fxy, and fyx. That’s at least one too many to keep track of. Luckily the gods of mathematics were kind to us. In their beneficence, they decided to help us out and make fxy = fyx whenever these two are continuous. We call these two derivatives the mixed second partials. So what we’re saying is that the mixed second partials are equal. Let’s highlight this fact. When all these partial derivatives are continuous, Since pretty much all the functions we ever deal with are continuous wherever defined, as are their derivatives, we don’t have to worry too much about that condition. Example 3 Check that the mixed second partials of f(x, y) = x2y3 + 7y sin x + 6x are equal. Solution fx = 2xy3 + 7y cos x + 6 so fxy = 6xy2 + 7 cos x On the other hand, fy = x23y2 + 7 sin x so fyx = 6xy2 + 7 cos x Lo and behold, fxy = fyx, another miracle brought to you by our sponsors. SO WHAT ARE PARTIALS GOOD FOR? We are so glad you asked that question. Let’s talk about mountains for a second. Suppose we want to climb Mount McDinkley, the highest mountain in Parmesan County. And suppose that the mountain is given by the graph of z = f(x, y). In order to climb to the top of the mountain, we need to be able to recognize when we are at the top. How do we tell when we are at the peak? At that point, any tangent line is horizontal, meaning its slope is",

We will do exactly that in the next section. Hey, whatever starches your toga. 8.6 Max-min problems In the real world we hold so dear, the most common problem we confront is to maximize or minimize some quantity subject to some constraint. For instance, maybe we’re on a diet and want to maximize the number of desserts we eat while keeping our intake below 125 calories. Or we have 1 week to study for four finals, and we want to apportion that study time to maximize our resultant grade point average. Or perhaps we have $2.74 and we want to maximize our caffeine buzz with only that much to spend. We call such a problem a constrained max-min problem. Let’s try a simple example. Example 1 Find three numbers x, y, and z that add up to 120 and such that their product is a maximum. Solution This is a classic type of problem, dating back to the Stone Age. But in the Stone Age, the biggest known number was 7, so the problems were easier. Step 1 Set up the function to be maximized and the so-called constraint equation. Let f(x, y, z) = xyz. This is the function we want to maximize. We are constrained by the equation x + y + z =",

(But since you asked so nicely, this ancient measure is the length from the elbow to the tip of the extended middle finger, about 18 inches. Ancient peoples always extended their middle fingers.

The cost of the top is the area of the top in square cubits times the cost per square cubit. The total cost is Step 4 Reduce the function to be maximized or minimized to two variables using the constraint equation. We will use the constraint equation to reduce the cost function to just two variables.

It could be that we have an attic with a sloping roof and we want to build the biggest box we can in that attic to hold the deformed monster that is the product of years of inbreeding within our royal family. Of course, that’s probably a long shot. More likely we make the deformed monster the new king and pretend there’s nothing wrong with him. Or maybe the volume of the box represents our profit as a function of three variables like the amount of capital we invest, the cost of labor, and the demand for our product.

The variables u and v are called the intermediate variables and x and y are the so-called independent variables as they do not depend on any of the other variables. We can think of this situation as the chain of financial support that runs through wealthy families. The grandparent w is giving money to the parents u and v, who in turn give the money to the children x and y. So indirectly, the children are being supported by the grandparents. Now, suppose we want to know the rate at which child x is draining the financial resources of the grandparent w. Then we are asking for . The chain rule for functions of more than one variable says: Chain Rule for Functions of More Than One Variable Figure 8.21 Skiing our way through the chain rule. In other words, the drain on w’s money is the drain due to parent u times the drain on u due to x plus the drain due to parent v times the drain on v due to x. How to remember this? Wealthy people ski a lot and the trick is to treat the diagram as if it is a chart of the ski trails at Mt. Snow. Each edge in the diagram is a trail with name given by the corresponding derivative. So the edge from u down to x corresponds to the derivative . If we want , that means we want to get from w at the top of the mountain down to x, which is the ski lodge at the bottom. (See Figure 8.21.) But we must include each possible trail down. Taking the trail through u, we obtain the term . Taking the trail through v, we obtain the term . Therefore, we have Similarly, by including both of the trails from w down to ski lodge y, we find Let’s try an example to see how we can compute with the chain rule. Example 1 Let w = u2v + 7v – u. If u = 2x2y and v = x + y2, find . Solution By our ski slope analysis, we know Plugging in the expressions for u and v gives an answer entirely in terms of x and y: Notice that this problem could also be done by plugging the expressions for u and v in terms of x and y into the expression for w, to obtain w entirely in terms of x and y and then taking . But there are many situations when we can’t do this. We used the chain rule to get in practice for those situations. Hey, whatever poaches your salmon. 8.8 The gradient and directional derivatives We’re now going to meet this object called the gradient. For now, it’s just a cute way to keep track of the two first partials. We put them in a vector, kind of like putting a present in a really nice box to make it look fancy. The finer stores understand this concept. Put a denim shirt in a plastic bag and it’s just a denim shirt. But fold it up really nice, with pins, wrap it in tissue, and place it in a black and gold box wrapped with gold ribbon, and suddenly it’s a Calvin Klein shirt at three times the price, even if it’s the same denim shirt. So we are going to dress up the first partials, by putting them in a pretty vector. No extra charge to you, our reader. WHAT’S THE GRADIENT? The gradient of a function f(x, y) is given by the formula It’s also often written as Seems like a silly way to store information, but as we’ll see shortly, it’s really handy. Example 1 Find the gradient of f(x, y) = x2y3 – 3x. Solution Well, = 2xy3 – 3 and = 3y2x2; so If you’re handed a function of three variables f(x, y, z), then the gradient has an extra term: Hey, whatever plucks your poultry. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES We’ve seen that and are slopes of tangent lines in the x- and y-directions. But what about all the other tangent lines? They are feeling left out. Maybe we are more interested in the rate of change of the hill in the south by southwest direction instead of the north-south or east-west directions. How do we find these other slopes?

You cling to the rock, as he screams gibberish at you and tries to pry your hands free. Every once in a while you kick at him, while hanging on for dear life. This wasn’t really the vacation you had in mind. Finally, the tour guide stops, throws his hands up in disgust, and steps off the mountain. You watch as he slides on his rear down the snow covered rock, and you realize that this is a shortcut to the bottom. He is taking the direction of steepest descent, sliding down the steep face on the newly laid snow. But he went so fast, you’re not sure which way is the direction of steepest descent. But you know your calculus, and you remember the fact that this portion of the mountain can be closely approximated by a function of form f(x, y) = y3 – 3x2y where you are at point (2, 4, 16). You remember the following amazing fact: The direction of steepest ascent is in the direction of f, and the directional derivative has magnitude |f| in this direction. The direction of steepest descent is in the direction of –f, and the directional derivative is –|f| in this direction. In your state of confusion, you decide you had better dredge up the reason that this fact is true just to check that you don’t have it backward. Why? The goal is to find the direction for the unit vector u that will maximize the directional derivative Duf, since when the directional derivative is as large as possible, the corresponding tangent line is as steeply sloped as possible. But the directional derivative is given by where θ is the angle between u and f. (See",

Similarly, if we want the minimum of the directional derivative, we want to take cos θ = – 1, so θ = π, meaning that u and f point in exactly opposite directions, or that u is in the direction of –f.

This fact that the gradient tells you the direction to head for the steepest ascent holds for functions of more variables as well.

Well, we can tell you what Lagrange’s mother did. She turned to little Joseph Louis and said, “Joe Lou, can you come up with a method for solving a problem like this?” She actually said it in French, bu the gist was as above. Now Joe Lou was a momma’s boy in the worst way. He would do anything to please his mother, even invent a difficult new mathematical concept. So he went off to his room to work on the problem. When he emerged 20 years later, he had invented the method of Lagrange multipliers. Sadly, while he worked alone in his room for all those years, his mother met a jolly butcher from Lyons named Jacques and she moved away. So when Joey finally emerged, he found himself all alone. It’s a sad story, we know, but hey, he got the method named after him, didn’t he? [Editor’s note: As far as we can tell, all of this is pure fabrication, with the exception that Lagrange did invent the method of Lagrange multipliers. We apologize profusely.] Here is the method for maximizing or minimizing f(x, y, z) subject to the constraint that g(x, y, z) =",

The hard part comes when you have to solve a set of four equations in four unknowns x, y, z, and λ. How do you do that? There is no single method that is the easiest. But there are a few things to try. Method 1 Eliminate variables, one at a time. So we may solve one of the equations to get x in terms of y, z, and λ. Then we use that equation to eliminate x from all of the equations. We then repeat the process again and again until we are down to one equation with one unknown which we can then solve. Method 2 Use the equations to obtain each variable x, y, and z in terms of λ. Then substitute these expressions into the constraint equation to obtain a single equation, all in terms of λ. Then solve for λ, which will then give you the other variables as well. Common Mistakes in Solving the Equations",

But we will get flat for a little while. It will help to clarify our 3D world when we return to it. Let’s start with distance.

Remember Camp Whatsitoya, where your parents sent you for 3 months that one summer, supposedly to experience the wonders of nature, but really because they just couldn’t stand to be around you for another second? And you know how the wonders of nature consisted primarily of mosquitos the size of Piper aircraft, and woods with a couple of scraggly pines growing in a field of poison ivy? And that entire summer, as you scratched yourself raw, the one thing that you looked forward to was archery. There was nothing quite like the zing of that arrow cutting through the air, heading straight and true for the target across the field. And as you watched it sink home, you would imagine it was your brother Everett, who was also at the camp, and who was the one person on Earth who could make you suffer more than the poison ivy. No, we haven’t gone off on this tangent (yes, that’s a little math pun, get used to it) because we have early signs of age-related dementia. We’re reminding you of all this because that arrow represents a vector. Think of that arrow as having been lofted into space, and then freeze time, so that all motion stops. Two quantities are relevant for that arrow as it sits frozen in space. The first is its length. After all, a long arrow can be shot a lot farther than a short one. The second relevant quantity is the direction in which the arrow is headed. What could be more important than that? The direction in which it heads will determine whether it ends up dead center in the bullseye or dead center in the rear of one of the campers waiting in line down at the latrine. We are not concerned at this point with where the arrow sits in space. We usually think of it situated with its tail at the origin, without changing its direction or its length. Then we use its other endpoint, the sharp end, to describe the vector. So the vector in Figure 5.2 is given by v = 2,",

When we place a vector so that it begins at the origin, its length is given by the Pythagorean theorem. Pythagorean Theorem If v = x, y, then |v| = . The length of a vector |v| is also called the norm or the magnitude of the vector. OPERATIONS ON VECTORS Even though they aren’t numbers, we can still add and subtract vectors. This is done componentwise. If v = x1, y1 and w = x2, y2, then v + w = x1 + x2, y1 + y2 and v – w = x1 – x2, y1 – y2 Addition and subtraction have geometric interpretations as well. Adding two vectors is the same as putting the first vector with its tail at the origin, and placing the second vector so that its tail begins at the tip of the first vector. The sum vector begins at the origin and ends at the tip of the second vector. Note that v + w = w + v, since we create a parallelogram with the same diagonal when adding them either way.

All of single-variable calculus (you know, the calculus we have done up to now) takes place in the xy-plane. That is to say, it occurs in a two-dimensional world. Pancake flat, unvarying, level as level can be. So flat, it makes Nebraska look mountainous. It’s so completely and totally flat that the grooves in a CD look like the Himalayas in comparison. We are talking falattt, smooth, constant, no change, no nothing, next gas station 2000 miles, not a bump, crumb, or dip for as far as the eye can see. Get the idea? Horifreaking-zontal. But do we live in a flat world like that? Of course not. We live in the full bloom of three dimensions, where everything has a solid, robust roundness to it. In our world, nothing is really completely two-dimensional. Even a playing card or a piece of Saran Wrap has some thickness. So it’s time to notch up our belts and take the math to another level. We want to describe the world we live in, that beautiful, juicy, sensuous, nectar-filled three-dimensional world we fondly call home. From now on, points will have three coordinates instead of two. We’re talking the full (x, y, z), from here on out. That’s right. We are now in three-dimensional space, fondly called 3-space, and going by the formal name of R3 (pronounced “R three”). DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS Let’s work out the formula for the distance between two points P(x0, y0, z",

SPHERES IN SPACE We all know about spheres, especially the famous one we all live on. That’s one big round ball, the Earth (or for you alien readers, Mars). The way to pin down a particular sphere in space is to give its center P(a, b, c), and its radius r. Then if Q(x, y, z) is any old point on the sphere, Squaring both sides we get this general equation.

If the two vectors point in approximately the same direction, we get a positive dot product, and the more lined up they are, the larger it is (unless the vectors are very short).

    "content": "Solution This is easy. WORK Physics has a very specific definition for “work” which may not be what you think. Suppose you spend the entire afternoon cleaning the apartment; you get down on your knees and scrub the bathroom floor, clean in those hard to reach places, make your roommate’s bed, the works. You lift the piano off the rug to clean underneath it. Finally you put everything neatly back where it started out. Your roomie comes home at the end of the day, and you say, “See all the work I’ve done?” But if she’s a physics major, she says, “Work, what work? You haven’t done any work. To do work, you must drag an object across the floor and then compute the force applied to the object times the distance that the object was pulled. You haven’t done any work at all.” This is an example of why it is not a good idea to have firearms in the house. In physics, the work done by a constant force in moving an object along a straight line is given by the dot product of the force vector F with the displacement vector D. The displacement vector D is the vector that begins where the object started and ends where the object ended. If the force vector and the displacement vector line up, the work is just the size of the force vector times the distance moved (which is the size of the displacement vector). On the other hand, if the force vector and the displacement vector are at right angles, the dot product will be 0, and the force does no work when the object is moved. The units used for force are called newtons in the metric system, and the unit used for work is the joule. One joule is the work done when an object is moved 1 meter against a force of 1 newton. The word “joule” comes from Newton’s rival Leibniz who said, “A jewel to whoever moves against Newton.” [Editor’s note: The authors made this up. I apologize.] Example 5 Fifi drags her owner along a sidewalk that’s 200 meters long. If Fifi (she’s a poodle, although I guess that’s obvious from the name) exerts a force of 2 newtons on the leash, and the leash is at an angle of 45° from the ground, how much work does Fifi do? Solution As in Figure 5.9, we can assume that Fifi and her owner start at (0,",

The force vector F therefore is twice this, and is given by Figure 5.9 The force of Fifi. The inner product of the displacement vector 200, 0 with the force vector gives the work done, which is therefore equal to 200 joules. If the force vector isn’t constant, we need to break the displacement into lots of teeny, nearly straight segments, along which the force vector is close to constant. We then add up the work done in all these little steps. The limit of this process gives an integral, which computes the work done by a nonconstant force along a nonstraight displacement. Later we’ll calculate quantities like this using line integrals. 5.5 The cross product DETERMINANTS Perhaps Arnold Schwarzenegger’s greatest unknown movie was “The Determinator.” Never screened, the movie showed Arnold sitting at a desk with a pencil and paper, working out determinants. It goes on like this for an hour and a half. Occasionally he turns to the camera and says, “Hasta la vista, baby.” Finally he gets frustrated, pulls out a submachine gun and a few grenades and gets into a gunfight with the Cleveland State Math Department. That’s the highlight of the movie. So just what were those determinants he was working on? Given a 2 × 2 array of four numbers, their determinant is Instead of writing “det,” we can use vertical bars around the array to represent the determinant. So Given a 3 × 3 array of numbers, we can take its determinant as follows: Example (3 × 3 Determinant) Determinants are very important in an area of mathematics called linear algebra. Linear algebra is essential for a variety of applications, from economics to computer graphics. While we don’t have to know too much about determinants to understand calculus, we do need to know how to calculate them for 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 matrices. DETERMINANTS AND THE CROSS PRODUCT Now we are going to take two vectors, tell them to multiply, and the result will be a new vector. Kind of like putting two people in a room, waiting nine months, and then out come three people. Of course, this doesn’t work so well if the two people are of the same gender. So we can think of the cross product as the result of two vectors meeting, falling in love, and having a child, who then grows up very tall and very very skinny, as vectors do. (See Figure 5.10.) The formula for the cross product of vectors a = a1, a2, a3 and b = b1, b2, b3 is Figure 5.10 The cross product a × b is perpendicular to each of a and b. Its direction is given by the thumb of the right hand when your fingers rotate from a to b. Remembering this formula would be a mental feat comparable to swimming the English Channel while reciting the “Bhagvat Gita.” Luckily, no one has to remember it. There is an easy way to get it. Taking the determinant of the matrix with first row i, j, k, second row a, and third row b gives a × b. We can check this by taking the determinant: Would you look at that? A perfect match with our previous formula for the cross product. Example 2 Find a × b when a = 1, 2, – 1 and b = –2, 3,",

Keep in mind that you can only take the cross product of two vectors and that the result will be a vector. Numerous jokes have been created to help you remember this fact. We’ll throw in a couple of new ones, as well. CROSS PRODUCT JOKES Question: What do you get when you cross a lion with a tiger? Answer: A vector perpendicular to both. Question: What do you get when you cross a lion with a mountain climber? Answer: Nothing, you can’t cross a vector with a scalar.* Question: What do you get when you cross a mosquito with a fish monger? Answer: Nothing, you can’t cross a (disease) vector with a (fish) scaler. Question: What do you get when you cross a mathematician with a movie star? Answer: Dream on, it’ll never happen. Question: Why did the chicken cross the road? Answer: To get a vector perpendicular to itself and the road. Question: If you take the vector A and cross it with the vector Dresser, what do you get? Answer: A cross dresser. Okay, okay, so they aren’t funny. But math jokes seldom are. Usually, the pleasure comes from relishing their truly pathetic nature. GEOMETRY OF THE CROSS PRODUCT We have talked about the direction of the cross product vector a × b. It is perpendicular to each of a and b, and it obeys the right-hand rule. But what about its magnitude? The magnitude of a × b is given by Here again, θ is the angle between the vectors a and b. Notice how similar it is to the formula we saw earlier: a · b = |a||b| cos θ. Be careful not to confuse these two. Also notice that the magnitude of the cross product does not depend on the order in which we take the cross product. In other words, By the right-hand rule, a × b will point in exactly the opposite direction from b × a. Two vectors that point in opposite directions and that have the same magnitude are just the negative of one another. In other words, That’s a fact worth remembering. YES, BUT WHAT’S THE CROSS PRODUCT GOOD FOR? How many times have you said to that special someone in your life, “Honey, what’s a simple formula for finding the area of a triangle when you have two vectors that give two of the adjacent edges?” Figure 5.11 Cross products let us measure areas of parallelograms and triangles. And that special someone responded, “I need to find a new special someone in my life.” Well, you needn’t worry that this scene will be repeated anymore, as there is a simple formula that we will tell you about now. Let’s look at the parallelogram in Figure 5.11 whose two adjacent sides are a and b. We can cut a right triangle off the left-hand side of the parallelogram and shift it over to the right side to create a rectangle with the same height and base length as the parallelogram. So A triangle with two adjacent sides a and b has area half that of the parallelogram, so we get the formula: This brings us to our next joke: Question: What do you get when you cross a hippo with a giraffe? Answer: A vector perpendicular to each whose length is the length of the hippo times the length of the giraffe times the sine of the angle between them. Hey, whatever blackens your catfish. THE SCALAR TRIPLE PRODUCT, OR THAT’S SOME PARALLELEPIPED YOU’RE PACKING Now, we can get really weird and take the product of THREE vectors. This isn’t really new; it’s just a combination of cross and dot products. If we do this just right, the number we get gives the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors. This is sort of like the skewed box that you’d get if you start with a carton and step on it until the three edges coming out of a corner give the three vectors shown in Figure 5.",

    "content": "Incidentally, being able to pronounce “parallelepiped” is a sure-fire way to impress anyone. Figure 5.12 Triple products give the volume of a parallelepiped. The formula for the triple product of vectors a, b, c is a · (b × c). If you get confused and instead calculate (a × b) · c, don’t worry—you’ll get the same answer. The answer is a number, that is to say a scalar, and its absolute value is the volume of the parallelepiped we discussed. Notice that we must do the cross product first and then the dot product. It makes no sense to try to calculate (a · b) × c. Doing the dot product first gives a scalar, and we can’t take the cross product of a scalar with a vector. And notice that after taking the dot product and cross product, the result is a number; the outer vertical bars mean to take the absolute values, so we can drop any minus sign at the end. Instead of actually taking the cross product and then the dot product, there is a simple formula for finding the scalar triple product: One application of this idea is to determine if three vectors lie in a plane. Three vectors lie in a plane precisely when the volume of the parallelepiped they span is zero. Example Do the vectors a = 1, 2, 3, b = 3, 2, 1, and c = 8, 4, 0 lie in a common plane? Solution Taking the scalar triple product gives The volume of the parallelepiped they span is zero and we conclude that the three vectors do lie in a common plane. More applications of the ideas from this chapter will appear in subsequent sections. As the chicken says, “We’ll cross that vector when we come to it.” Hey, whatever chokes your throttle. 5.6 Lines in space Remember how you learned to graph lines in the xy-plane? You would have an equation like y = 2x + 3, and you would determine all of the points (x, y) that satisfy that equation. In particular, in this case, the slope is 2 and the y-intercept is 3, so it’s easy to describe the line. Life (and lines) won’t be quite that simple in 3-space. Here, instead of one equation, we will use three equations to describe a line. Let’s start by figuring out what we need to determine a line. Suppose that we have a point P on the line and a vector v in the direction of the line. Then there is a unique line that passes through the point in the direction of the vector. The point and the vector completely determine the line. This is just the way life is, too. One point and a direction often determine a life. For instance, Christopher Columbus (see Figure 5.",

If we switch the roles of P0 and P1, we get the parametric equations These (and many others) are perfectly good parametric equations for the line. The symmetric equations are obtained by solving each of the parametric equations for t, and setting them all equal. So, using the first set of parametric equations, we have 5.7 Planes in space The word “plane” comes from the Latin word planus, which means flat, or level, no features to speak of. Hence, the Latin expression “Planus Janus,” which we now say as “Plain Jane” or “Planus in the Anus,” which means uncomfortable chair. We would like some means of keeping track of planes in space. Suppose we are on a flying carpet and we want it to take us to the Snack Bar so we can impress everyone there. Unlike what occurs in cartoons, a flying carpet can neither speak nor understand English. So how do we get it to go where we want it to go? Well, the truth of the matter is that there is a joystick sticking right out of the bathmat, perpendicular to it. Since the carpet must stay perpendicular to the joystick, we can steer it. In other words, this perpendicular stick determines the orientation of the rug in space. (To get the carpet to go forward or backward you give it a good kick.) The same idea can be used to describe a plane in space. Let’s take a vector n = a, b, c perpendicular to the plane, which we call a normal vector. (There are no abnormal vectors. “Normal” is just another word for “perpendicular.” On the other hand, there are abnormal Victors. Take for instance Victor Lamazz of 34 West Huntington Blvd., Chicago.) Then we take a point P0 = (x0 y0, z",
